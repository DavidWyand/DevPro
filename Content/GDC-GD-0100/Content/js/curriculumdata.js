In this, the game design curriculum, we will learn about game theory, game design, and along the way, make a few stops to consider the workings of the video game industry. Through video lectures, hands-on exercises, assessments, and more will we dive into the fascinating world of video game design and development.<\/p>  <p>The game design curriculum is divided into four arcs containing multiple related Modules:<\/p>  <h2>Arc One: Intro to Game Development<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/navsection_arc1.png\" alt=\"navsection_arc1\" width=\"746\" height=\"417\" \/> <p>In Arc One, intro to game development, we look at the history of video games and the rise of technology and iconic game developers who have made the game industry what it is today. From there we examine some of the lexicon of developers and then dive into game theory as a primer for understanding how game designers think. <\/p> <h2>Arc Two: Game Design Basics<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/navsection_arc2.png\" alt=\"navsection_arc2\" width=\"746\" height=\"417\" \/> <p>In Arc Two. Game Design Basics, we begin with the importance of documentation and quickly move on to discussions on mechanics, game structure, and level design.<\/p> <h2>Arc Three: Implementing Game Design<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/navsection_arc3.png\" alt=\"navsection_arc3\" width=\"746\" height=\"417\" \/> <p>Arc three, implementing game design, will take us to deeper levels of understanding game design as we apply common design theories, discuss visuals and delve into characters and story.<\/p>  <h2>Arc Four: Game Design Project<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/navsection_arc4.png\" alt=\"navsection_arc4\" width=\"746\" height=\"417\" \/> <p>Finally, in Arc Four, we will look some industry matters such as careers in video games and intellectual property issues, leading to our capstone exercise project.<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#course-introduction-2\">User Interface<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#course-introduction-3\">Pop-Up Quiz<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#course-introduction-4\">Game Stack<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"course-introduction-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>User Interface<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/navopening2.png\" alt=\"navopening2\" width=\"746\" height=\"417\" \/><p>The above screen is typical of all the Modules in the course.

Today, games are being developed for education, career training, test simulations, and of course, good old fashion fun. In this module we will examine the history and growth of the video game industry from its roots in computing and the military to the heights of popularity through the invention and innovation of iconic developers.<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#history-of-game-development-2\">History of Video Game Technology<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#history-of-game-development-3\">Evolution of the Video Game Industry<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#history-of-game-development-4\">Exploring Non-Digital Games<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#history-of-game-development-5\">Exploring Video Game Genres<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#history-of-game-development-6\">Iconic Video Game Designers and Developers<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a id=\"history-of-game-development-2\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>History of Video Game Technology<\/h1><p>Video game technology grew from advancements in computer technology over the course of a century of development. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of our modern day input devices were developed during times of war. This lesson will briefly discuss how advances in computers and gaming tech came about and turned into a multi-billion dollar industry.<\/p><h3>1930s<\/h3><p>Perhaps the most significant early invention for the future development of video games is the theoretical Turing Machine developed by Alan Turing in 1936. Alan did not build an actual machine but rather developed the concept of a machine that could perform mathematical calculations.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1930s.png\" alt=\"Image_1930s\" width=\"575\" height=\"377\" \/><h3>1940s<\/h3><p>Early analog computer technology found applications in scientific research and industrial use, but the benefits of computer technology was perhaps most useful to the military. In particular, analog technology was used during World War II to increase the accuracy of bombers and for the advanced fire control of artillery weapons.<\/p><p>World War II also saw the invention of some familiar looking controller devices. Radar plotting systems of this era utilized the first \"trackball\" and joystick devices to assist in tracking aircraft.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1940s.png\" alt=\"Image_1940s\" width=\"516\" height=\"404\" \/><h3>1950s<\/h3><p>In the 1950s the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) was invented to display color images on a television screen, creating early monitor technology.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1950s.png\" alt=\"Image_1950s\" width=\"657\" height=\"332\" \/><h3>1960s<\/h3><p>The 1960s saw the introduction of the video display terminal (VDT) combined with electric typewriter using CRT technology. This breakthrough meant that users could now see what they were typing represented on a monitor. This seemingly minor advancement allowed for far greater complexity in computer programming and applications. In addition, this era introduced the first mouse.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1960s.png\" alt=\"Image_1960s\" width=\"419\" height=\"380\" \/><h3>1970s<\/h3><p>By the 1970s VDT technology became fast enough to keep up with typists and the QWERTY keyboard layout became an industry standard.  Later in the decade, the Xerox Alto computer utilized what would become the modern mouse.<\/p><p>The late 1970s brought the first generation of gaming consoles and the beginnings of what would become the multi-billion dollar Video Game Industry we know today.<\/p><p>Although not the first ever digital video game, Pong was the first video game widely played in homes. The technology included:<\/p><ul><li>        Discrete transistor-based digital game logic<\/li><li>        Black and white screen<\/li><li>        Single channel audio or no audio<\/li><\/ul><p>The Atari 2600 gaming console is released in 1978 and is a tremendous success. This system utilizes ROM cartridges allowing for greater variety of games to be played by a console as well as color graphics. From there each new generation of consoles introduces new advances in computers and gaming technology that increases at an amazing rate. (See Topic: Evolution of Video Games in this Module for more details)<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1970s.png\" alt=\"Image_1970s\" width=\"759\" height=\"299\" \/><h3>1980s<\/h3><p>Microsoft takes what is considered a risk at the time and makes their new MS-DOS Microsoft Word work with a mouse. It is a success and the mouse becomes standard equipment for all future PCs.<\/p><p>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) releases in America (1985) and revitalizes a floundering home gaming industry. Packed with this new system is an 8 bit microprocessor and the first D-Pad controller, Zapper light gun and the Robotic Operating Body (ROB).<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1980s.png\" alt=\"Image_1980s\" width=\"650\" height=\"249\" \/><h3>1990s<\/h3><p>By the early 1990s microprocessors have doubled again to 16 bits. Hand-held gaming systems appear (Gameboy) and signal the popularity of \"gaming on the go\" that will hit mainstream heights in the near future. Consoles now boast more colors and advanced sound capabilities such as stereo and music synthesis. By the end of the 90's CD-ROMs and 3D games are introduced and utilized in console systems.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_1990s.png\" alt=\"Image_1990s\" width=\"656\" height=\"313\" \/><h3>Early 2000s<\/h3><p>Modern consoles begin to turn to PC-like architecture for the next generation designs. Microsoft releases the Xbox which includes an internal hard drive and the ability to access online downloadable content. The Internet becomes a viable source for entertainment, including games<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_2000s.png\" alt=\"Image_2000s\" width=\"562\" height=\"299\" \/><h3>Today<\/h3><p>Modern gaming technology now includes fully realized online gaming applications through social media sites like Facebook. Blu-Ray, motion control and wireless connections are new standards. Fully integrated Internet media is a reality with content streaming and downloadable content. Smart devices such as cell phones and tablets have captivated mainstream audiences, turning the gaming industry to a multi-billion dollar juggernaut that has topped the movie industry in consumer dollars spent.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3142 size-full\" src=\".\/images\/Image_Today.png\" alt=\"Image_Today\" width=\"656\" height=\"309\" \/><\/div><a id=\"history-of-game-development-3\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Evolution of the Game Industry<\/h1><p>Video games have grown from following a white dot across a black screen to nearly photo-realistic simulations of life itself. Today the video game industry is a multi-billion dollar monster that regularly sees sales of major releases topping Hollywood blockbusters. This lesson will briefly look at the different generations of consoles and the companies that brought video games to the masses.<\/p><h3>First Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p><em>Pong<\/em> is developed by Atari on the first home gaming system, Odyssey, and features a table tennis game utilizing 2D graphics and minimal sound (Single Channel Audio). Released to the public as a home system in 1974, the technology used discrete transistor-based digital game logic and black and white color. Believe it or not, <em>Pong<\/em> was amazing technology to behold in the early 70s and was an instant success, establishing video games as a viable money making industry. With success, however, came multiple competitors (first console wars); and by 1977, the industry was heading for a crash.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3144 size-full\" src=\".\/images\/Image_FirstGen.png\" alt=\"Image_FirstGen\" width=\"381\" height=\"417\" \/><h3>Second Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p>Enter the Atari 2600. Released to the public in 1977, this home system used microprocessor-based technology and encoded ROM cartridges that allowed the console to conceivably play an unlimited number of games.  It also introduced limited color and more sound options. Again, a video game system for the home was a huge success and the Atari 2600 (along with competitors Intellivision) became market leaders that revitalized the home gaming industry.<\/p><p>With the success of the Atari 2600 came changes in the industry. Perhaps most significant during this era, is the founding of Activision by disgruntled employees of Atari who felt they were not getting the credit they deserved for designing and programming the games that made the Atari 2600 such a public phenomenon.<\/p><p>As an unintended consequence, this increase in popularity for home video game systems also signaled the end of the short lived arcade stand-up video game industry model. By 1983, the arcade model of video games crashed, never to recover to the same heights again.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SecondGen.png\" alt=\"Image_SecondGen\" width=\"561\" height=\"236\" \/><h3>Third Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p>The third generation of consoles was launched by a company you may have heard of called Nintendo. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) released in America in 1985 and was a massive hit with both Japanese and American audiences. With the Atari 2600 becoming old technology and new Atari systems failing in the market, the NES seized the public's attention and revitalized the home gaming industry. The system was designed to appeal to kids as a toy and included a D-Pad controller, Zapper light gun and the Robotic Operating Buddy (ROB) as standard with purchase of the system. Nintendo further solidified its place in gaming history by creating iconic game characters such as Mario Bros and Link from the Zelda series of games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_ThirdGen.png\" alt=\"Image_ThirdGen\" width=\"618\" height=\"351\" \/><h3>Fourth Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p>The Fourth Generation of consoles is official with the release of the Sega Genesis system, the first gaming platform to feature 16 bit graphics, a full spectrum of colors and advanced sound with music synthesis and stereo. Sega's hold on the market is short lived, however, as Nintendo releases their new 16 system, the Super NES in 1990. In the end, Nintendo once again reigns supreme in sales.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_FourthGen.png\" alt=\"Image_FourthGen\" width=\"617\" height=\"233\" \/><h3>Fifth Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p>In 1994, Sony enters the gaming market with the release of the Sony Playstation. It is a huge success and becomes the market leader over the new Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. Significant in this era of consoles is that it marks the beginning of 3D games and the integration of CD-ROM players and disks as the format of choice for games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_FifthGeneration.png\" alt=\"Image_FifthGeneration\" width=\"735\" height=\"423\" \/><h3>Sixth Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p>In 2000, Sony releases what will become the most popular and successful gaming console in history – the Sony Playstation 2. At the same time, Nintendo releases its Nintendo Gamecube and Microsoft enters the market with its PC-like architecturally designed Xbox. Now begins what most consider the real console wars between the three remaining juggernauts of gaming. Also of note, this era of consoles began to integrate with rapidly advancing Internet technology and the concept of online games and downloadable content is sparked.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SixthGen.png\" alt=\"Image_SixthGen\" width=\"800\" height=\"329\" \/><h3>Seventh Generation Game Consoles<\/h3><p>Seventh Generation consoles spawn only five years after the sixth as technology progresses at lightning speed. All three major game system manufactures release newer, better systems: Microsoft Xbox 360 (2005), Sony Playstation 3 (2006); and the Nintendo Wii (2006). Sony and Microsoft release compatible systems to their predecessors, featuring better graphics and sound, access to online downloadable content, and wireless technology. Only the Nintendo Wii breaks the mold and features motion control party games as its major appeal. Although competition is perhaps the fiercest it has ever been, the massive popularity of video games at this point means enough market share for all three systems to be wildly successful.<\/p><p>It is in this generation of gaming that game developer studios rose as giants of the industry. Activision continues its independent game development achievements but is dwarfed by companies such as EA, Valve, Bungie and Blizzard. The time of the multi-billion dollar game industry has come and as video games compete with Hollywood blockbusters for consumer dollars, game properties themselves become adapted movie features and movies begin to be turned in to games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SeventhGen.png\" alt=\"Image_SeventhGen\" width=\"699\" height=\"332\" \/><h3>Eighth Generation Game Consoles – CURRENT ERA<\/h3><p>Today the industry is in its Eighth Generation. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo remain the market leaders as they release their newest and most powerful systems: Microsoft Xbox One; Sony Playstation 4; and the Nintendo WII U. These systems all feature full online media integration (content streaming, downloadable content), nearly photorealistic graphics and processors that compete with PCs. Even with this market share, the dominance of these companies is threatened by new trends in technology.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_EighthGen.png\" alt=\"Image_EighthGen\" width=\"664\" height=\"355\" \/><h3>Non-Console Home Gaming<\/h3><p>Internet gaming is seen by many as the future. Streaming content allows people to play games from their PCs that overmatch even the newest consoles in terms of visuals and content flexibility. In addition, smart phone and tablet gaming has hit critical mass and has found a mainstream audience unimagined by the old school giants. Hosted gaming has also proven popular among untraditional video game fans through social media sites like Facebook.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_NonConsole.png\" alt=\"Image_NonConsole\" width=\"563\" height=\"278\" \/><\/div><a id=\"history-of-game-development-4\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Exploring Non-Digital Games (and their influence on video games)<\/h1><p>Games are as old as human history. They permeate every culture and reflect and define our social values. Today, as people find more free time and as technology expands, games are more popular and pervasive than ever. In this Topic, we will examine some of the games that influenced and helped shaped digital video games.<\/p><h3>Early Board Games<\/h3><p>The oldest known board game – <em>Senet<\/em> – was discovered in a Predynastic Egyptian tomb in 3500 BC. <em>Backgammon<\/em> is probably the oldest game still played today and can be traced back to Biblical times with variations found across ancient Europe and Asia. <em>Chess<\/em> dates back to around the 6<sup>th<\/sup> century AD and was passed from culture to culture through various assimilations of people via conquering nations. What these games have in common is a focus on strategy and critical thinking: elements that are perfect for expansion and exploration in video games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_EarlyBoardGames.png\" alt=\"Image_EarlyBoardGames\" width=\"618\" height=\"257\" \/><h3>The Family Board Game<\/h3><p>By the close of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, board games were not only growing in popularity, they became profitable for game developers. Parker Brothers, founded by George S. Parker in 1883, became a successful manufacture and distributor of card and board games.<\/p><p>During the Great Depression Parker Brothers released <em>Monopoly<\/em>. It was an instant hit and remains popular to this day. Parker Brothers would go on in the next several decades to produce many long lasting games such as <em>Clue, Risk<\/em> and <em>Sorry!<\/em><\/p><p>Although wildly popular, even today, these games lack complex game design. In fact, most games in this category are barely much more than games of chance and luck.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_FamilyBoardGames.png\" alt=\"Image_FamilyBoardGames\" width=\"576\" height=\"301\" \/><h3>Strategy War Games<\/h3><p>Sometimes called bookshelf games, Strategy War games combine the complex strategy of chess-like games with elements of a classic board game. Typically, these games included a massive rulebook, a large map and hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny cardboard chits representing troops, artillery, or other military units. These games often focused on real-life battles and historical time periods such as World War II or the clashes of ancient armies.<\/p><p>In many ways, these games are the predecessors to computer Turn-Based Strategy games; and to some extent Strategy 4X games. Once the complexities of the rules were automated and simplified by programming, computer Strategy War Games became wildly popular. Unfortunately for some, this digital transition effectively killed the Bookshelf Strategy War game as a non-digital gaming option (there is always Ebay!).<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_StrategyWarGame.png\" alt=\"Image_StrategyWarGame\" width=\"520\" height=\"311\" \/><h3>Table-Top Role Playing Games<\/h3><p>Another non-digital genre of games that have heavily influenced video games is the Tabletop Role-Playing game (RPG). <em>Dungeons and Dragons<\/em>, created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, is perhaps the best known and most iconic of all RPGs. Role-Playing games are quite different than any other traditional game, mostly in that \"winning\" becomes secondary to storytelling. Players create a character that is represented by a series of abilities, stats and powers. Traditionally, there is no board to look at: the game is played mostly in the mind using imagination and a hand full of polygonal dice. A Game Master (GM) guides the rest of the players through an adventure but it is not his job to defeat them. Instead, enjoyment of the game comes from the group of players cooperating to overcome challenges created by the GM with the intention that they succeed and grow stronger for the next more challenging adventure. Settings for a RPG include fantasy, science fiction, and even the real world.<\/p><p>As with Strategy War games, converting this style of game into a video game has many benefits. The game itself calculates success or failure instantly and without the need for dice. It also, for better or worse, eliminates some need for imagination by replacing a GM's description with fully realized art and settings. It also removes the need for a GM, since the game program itself becomes the guide and storyteller. Of course, this also greatly limits one of the best features of a tabletop RPG: unlimited choices.<\/p><p>In any event, <em>D&amp;D<\/em> was the grandfather of all RPGs, both digital and non-digital, and remains popular as a pen and paper game. Unfortunately, <em>Dungeons and Dragons<\/em> as a video game intellectual property has faltered and been overtaken by its imitators. Games such as <em>World of Warcraft<\/em> have captured the spirit and feel of <em>Dungeons and Dragons<\/em> and conquered their own space in the RPG video game market. Still, the overall effect of <em>Dungeons and Dragons<\/em> in video games is nothing short of tremendous.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_TabletopRPGs.png\" alt=\"Image_TabletopRPGs\" width=\"400\" height=\"315\" \/><h3>Advanced Board Games<\/h3><p>Even as certain non-digital game genres become forever absorbed in to video games, the current options for board games are beyond outstanding. As the limited strategy and gameplay potential of family board games become more and more obvious, a whole new crop of intellectually challenging board games have come to market. In these games, thought has gone into their game design to make them more than experiences of random chance. <em>Settlers of Catan<\/em> is a popular game in this category.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_AdvancedBoardGames.png\" alt=\"Image_AdvancedBoardGames\" width=\"269\" height=\"422\" \/><h3>Card Games<\/h3><p>Card games have always been popular, but for most their history they have been limited to variations on the standard 52-playing card deck. Video games have certainly embraced common card games, but today a card game can be so much more than <em>Go Fish<\/em>. Collectable Strategy Card games are a fairly new concept in gaming and have opened up amazing new strategies and styles of play. Most popular of the paper stock versions of these games is <em>Magic: The Gathering<\/em>, invented by Richard Garfield in 1993.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_CardGames.png\" alt=\"Image_CardGames\" width=\"472\" height=\"329\" \/><\/div><a id=\"history-of-game-development-5\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Video Game Genres<\/h1><h3>Arcade Games<\/h3><p>Arcade-style games are fast-paced, flashy, and usually repeat the same gameplay each time the game is restarted. These games require hand-to-eye coordination and fast muscle reactions (sometimes called Twitch). Players typically have to overcome waves of enemies and obstacles in ever-increasing difficulty. Arcade games were initially stand-up machines that were popularized in  arcades in the early 1980s. Today the term arcade game relates to their style of play rather than where they are played. Games that fall into the Arcade Game category include:<\/p><ul><li>Hack and Slash.<\/li><li>Fighting Games.<\/li><li>Pinball.<\/li><li>Fighter Pilot.<\/li><li>Racing.<\/li><li>Platform Jumper<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_ArcadeGames1.png\" alt=\"Image_ArcadeGames\" width=\"766\" height=\"431\" \/><h3>Role-Playing Games<\/h3><p>Role-Playing games are story driven quests where the player takes the role of a character within the game that they will develop and explore a world with. RPG's come in an amazing variety, but usually involve exploration of a large game world or map, continuous player advancement through gaining experience points and unlocking new or better abilities, and a conclusive ending when the storyline is completed. Sub-genres of RPG's include:<\/p><ul><li>Fantasy RPG's<\/li><li>Sci-Fi RPG's<\/li><li>Historical RPG's<\/li><li>Western RPG's.<\/li><li>Eastern RPG's.<\/li><li>Action Adventure.<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_RolePlayingGames.png\" alt=\"Image_RolePlayingGames\" width=\"564\" height=\"473\" \/><h3>Strategy Games<\/h3><p>Strategy games are mass combat games that require short-term and long-term troop and resource strategies in order to accomplish complex victory conditions over another opponent.  Victory conditions are typically achieved through a balanced allocation of effort in gathering and allocating resources, moving and commanding armies in battle, and researching new technologies. Strategy games can further be categorized as follows:<\/p><ul><li>Turn-based strategy.<\/li><li>Real-time strategy.<\/li><li>4X strategy.<\/li><li>Time-based strategy.<\/li><li>Tower defense.<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_StrategyGames.png\" alt=\"Image_StrategyGames\" width=\"710\" height=\"527\" \/><h3>Puzzle Games<\/h3><p>Puzzle games focus on a problem, riddle, or brainteaser the player must solve using the provided interface and a designated set of conditions. Puzzle games can be played individually or often in competition with other players. Puzzles can be text based and\/or graphic based, and often blend elements of arcade games. Puzzle games can focus entirely on the puzzle, or be minor aspects of other games such as a Sphinx issuing a riddle in a RPG. Typical puzzle games include:<\/p><ul><li>Action puzzle.<\/li><li>Matching Tiles.<\/li><li>Logic.<\/li><li>Traditional puzzles.<\/li><li>Physics.<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_PuzzleGames.png\" alt=\"Image_PuzzleGames\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" \/><h3>Sports Games<\/h3><p>Sports games are simulators that deliver a life-like digital version of popular sports. These games are often licensed with professional leagues and represent some of the most popular games on the market. Modern sports games are near perfect models of sporting completions and leagues and offer amazing detail and complexity. Players often have the options of managing teams and players as well as controlling the action on the field. Includes generic (non-professional) sports games.<\/p><ul><li>League Sports Games (football, baseball, basketball, etc.)<\/li><li>Individual Sports Games (skiing, golf, boxing)<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SportsGames.png\" alt=\"Image_SportsGames\" width=\"691\" height=\"245\" \/><h3>Simulation Games<\/h3><p>Simulation games depict real world scenarios in which players either participate in as a controllable character or control the world itself as an omnipotent overlord. Often simulation games include tactical combat, organizing the planned growth of societies, and increasing game complexity as one progresses.<\/p><ul><li>Life-sim.<\/li><li>City-sim.<\/li><li>Industry-sim.<\/li><li>Survival-horror.<\/li><li>Tactical-shooter.<\/li><li>Adult games.<\/li><li>Religious games.<\/li><li>Educational games.<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SimulationGames.png\" alt=\"Image_SimulationGames\" width=\"699\" height=\"299\" \/><h3>Massively Multiplayer Online Games<\/h3><p>Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games situate hundreds or thousands of players into the same digital world and allow them to interact, cooperate and compete. MMO's are played entirely online and usually are connected to another genre such as Role Playing Games or Simulation Games.<\/p><ul><li>MMORPG's.<\/li><li>MMO-Strategy.<\/li><li>MMO-Simulation.<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_MMOGames.png\" alt=\"Image_MMOGames\" width=\"716\" height=\"311\" \/><h3>Social Games<\/h3><p>Social Games are video games typically created for non-gamer mainstream audiences to simulate social interaction or enhance a social gathering. Social games are usually played with other people present in the same room and using a communal monitor as the springboard for various interactive gameplay.<\/p><ul><li>Party games.<\/li><li>Dance games.<\/li><\/ul><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SocialGames.png\" alt=\"Image_SocialGames\" width=\"633\" height=\"342\" \/><\/div><a id=\"history-of-game-development-6\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Iconic Game Designers and Developers<\/h1><h3>Alexey Pajitnov<\/h3><p>Alexey Pajitnov is the inventor and developer of what is perhaps the most popular video game of all time:<em> Tetris.

Born in Japan in 1965, Satoshi was an avid video game player. He was also an enthusiastic collector of insects. It was the odd combination of these two passions that spawned the games <em>Pokémon Red<\/em> and <em>Pokémon Green<\/em>. When added with the other <em>Pokémon<\/em> titles, this intellectual property became a multi-billion dollar franchise and a huge success for Nintendo's Gameboy system. Tajiri is also credited with contributing on other iconic IPs such as the <em>Mario Bros<\/em> series of games and the <em>Legend of Zelda<\/em>.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_SatoshiTajiri.png\" alt=\"Image_SatoshiTajiri\" width=\"545\" height=\"251\" \/><h3>Richard Garriott<\/h3><p>One of the more colorful figures in video game development is Richard Garriott, also known by his alter ego, Lord British, in the <em>Ultima<\/em> series of computer games. The <em>Ultima<\/em> games were a wildly popular series of early computer role-playing games that have evolved into a MMO. Garriott is also famous for being a science and space enthusiast and purchasing his way to a visit to the International Space Station in 2008.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Image_RichardGarriott.png\" alt=\"Image_RichardGarriott\" width=\"693\" height=\"339\" \/><h3>Shigeru Miyamoto<\/h3><p>Often referred to as, “The father of modern gaming” Shigeru Miyamoto's amazing legacy is summed up in the game titles he created and developed including <em>Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, Star Fox<\/em> and the <em>Legend of Zelda<\/em> series to name just a few.

An acronym is when a word is formed from the first letters of words in a phrase to create a new “word” or term that now defines that phrase.<\/p><p>The following are some examples of common acronyms that students will probably recognize:<\/p><p>SCUBA is an acronym for \"Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus\".<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_scuba.png\" alt=\"image_scuba\" width=\"521\" height=\"256\" \/><p>DIY is an acronym for \"Do It Yourself\".<\/p><p>ASAP is an acronym for \"As Soon As Possible\".<\/p><p>LASER is an acronym for \"Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation\"<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_laser.png\" alt=\"image_laser\" width=\"519\" height=\"254\" \/><\/div>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Common Video Game Industry Terms and Acronyms<\/h1><p><em>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)<\/em><\/p><p>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides conveniences to programmers. IDE's are designed to help programmers maximize their productivity by offering tools such as source code editors, and features for modifying, debugging, and developing other software. Often, IDEs are specific to a programming language and offer features that are tied to aiding in that particular language.<\/p><p><em>Examples: Eclipse, Microsoft Visual Studios for use with C#<\/em><\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Application Programming Interface (API)<\/em><\/p><p>Application Programming Interface  (API) allows programmers and Web developers to access tools to interact and design products or services connected to or powered by a particular piece of software. This is an intentional goal of the makers of the original software to allow other developers to utilize their software and do so more easily with an API.<\/p><p><em>Example: <a style=\"font-style: normal; color: #21759b !important;\" href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon.com<\/a><span style=\"color: #3f4549;\"> offers an API to sellers so they can access Amazon product information and easily display it on their own website<\/span><\/em><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><em>Software Development Kit (SDK)<\/em><\/p><p>Also called a “devkit”, a Software Development Kit (SDK) offers development tools that allow the creation of applications for particular software products. A SDK may include the implementation of an API through an IDE.<\/p><p><em>Example: Apple's iOS 8 SDK<\/em><\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Repository<\/em><\/p><p>A repository is a location for storing and monitoring data, such as code or art. In addition to storing the files, a repository tracks users and their changes to create a history of the project's development. This is the core component of a source control management (SCM) system.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Source Control Management (SCM)<\/em><\/p><p>Source Control Management (SCM) implements two primary functions: retrieving a specified set of changes from the repository or adding a specified set of changes to a repository. SCMs (also called Software Configuration Management) enable developers many options and securities such as parallel development, file integrity and protection, organizational tools, and quick development and revision tools.<\/p><p><em>Examples:  Apache Subversion (<span style=\"color: #3f4549;\">SVN), GitHub<\/span><\/em><\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Game Design Document (GDD)<\/em><\/p><p>A Game Design Document (GDD) is the key manuscript\/blueprint of a video game. Its purpose is to describe in keen detail the entire design of the entire game with meticulous language and perfect structure. It is the video game industry's version of a movie script, storyboard and shooting schedule all-in-one. With a proper GDD, developers have a complete plan and layout of the game and how its development will be executed. Our understanding of a Game Design Document will be greatly expanded in the next Arc of this Course.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Technical Design Document (TDD)<\/em><\/p><p>Where the Game Design Document is a documentation of a game's design and function, the Technical Design Document (TDD) refers to the actual programming and technical architecture of the game. It is a highly procedural document specifying the implementation of programming, hosting or other complex technical information not in the GDD.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Game Engine<\/em><\/p><p>A Game Engine is a software framework specifically geared toward creating video games without building them from the ground up. Game engines tend to offer several complete systems or tools, which developers would normally have to code themselves. For example, a game engine may offer full 3D rendering, a GUI system, scripting, physics, AI, and so on. Some engines also ship with tools, such as level and particle editors, to further facilitate rapid development of a new game project.<\/p><p><em>Examples: Torque 2D, Torque 3D, Unreal, MonoGame, Unity<\/em><\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Non-Player Character (NPC)<\/em><\/p><p>This is a term most often used in Role-Playing Games (RPGs). It refers to people, monsters, or other in-game characters that are not controlled by a Player. An NPC can be helpful (quest giver), hostile (enemy to fight), or just hang around looking pretty (décor). Their purpose is to offer allies, challenges and characters to build world and story with.<\/p><p><em>Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)<\/em><\/p><p>A committee that reviews video game content and issues ratings categories to inform consumers of a game's age appropriateness (USA\/Canada\/Mexico). Similar systems include PEGI (Europe\/Israel\/Canada) and CERO (Japan). The Apple App Store and Google Play also have their own rating systems.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"industry-terminology-3\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Common Tools and Software Used to Develop Video Games<\/h1>&nbsp;<p>As the game development industry has grown, so has they technology to build games. Today there are many tools and programs out there specifically designed to aid in game development. Though most of these will not be utilized in this curriculum, it is still good to know what they are and how they help developers make games cheaper, faster and better.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Maya <\/em><\/p><p>Maya is 3D graphics software used to create 3D visual effects for video games, animation, and other entertainment media. Maya is mostly known for its robust animation tools.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Autodesk 3ds Max <\/em><\/p><p>Like Maya, and now owned by the same parent company, Autodesk 3ds Max is another 3D computer graphics program. It is used in the industry mostly for modeling, texturing and rendering.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Adobe Photoshop<\/em><\/p><p>This is a popular program used to create and manipulate visual images. Photoshop is widely used in video game development and across visual media.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Adobe Creative Suite<\/em><\/p><p>A bundle of Adobe applications that include Photoshop, Acrobat, InDesign and other programs used in games, video editing, and Web development projects.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>MonoGame<\/em><\/p><p>MonoGame allows game developers to make their Windows App games run on other phone and tablet systems such as Mac OS, Android and others. Note that this curriculum uses MonoGame when it is necessary for students to do exercises involving code.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Unity (Game Engine)<\/em><\/p><p>Widely used cross-platform game building engine with many features including a built-in Integrated Development Environment (IDE).<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Subversion (SVN)<\/em><\/p><p>Source Control (or Version Control) software that allows developers to use a common source repository and file tracking.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Git<\/em><\/p><p>Git is Source Code Management (SCM) and revision control software that is designed to speed up the development process. Git is free software.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Microsoft Visual Studio<\/em><\/p><p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft specifically to aid computer programs and video games progress for Windows systems.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Zbrush<\/em><\/p><p>A widely used digital sculpting tool that aids in 2D\/3D models, painting, and textures. It is often used in video games, movies, and high-quality animations.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Microsoft Word<\/em><\/p><p>This widely used text editor is an invaluable tool for writers, game designers, and producers.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Microsoft Excel<\/em><\/p><p>Also part of the Microsoft Office suite is Microsoft's spreadsheet program, Excel. This program is used  to organize charts and data and to preform complex analyses of that data.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Torque 3D (Game Engine)<\/em><\/p><p>Another popular video game engine for 3D games that is now free under the MIT License.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><em>Marmalade<\/em><\/p><p>Cross platform Software Development Kit (SDK) for C++ (a programming language).<\/p>&nbsp;<\/div><!--page:~~industry-terminology-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":".\/exercise\/QuizShow.stack","instructions":"<h1>Goals<\/h1><ol><li>Learn key terminology and acronyms of the game industry.<\/li><\/ol><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Click the <img src=\".\/images\/downloadbutton.png\" alt=\"layout.png\"\/> button at the top or bottom of this page to download the QuizShow.stack file.<\/li><li>Save the file to a location you can access on your computer.<\/li><li>Click to open the file in Game Stack.<\/li><li>Run the game by clicking the green flag button <img src=\".\/images\/gamestackflag.png\" alt=\"gamestackflag.png\"\/><\/li><li>Follow the directions on screen, and answer each of the questions<\/li><\/ol><h1>Extra Credit<\/h1><ol><li>Using the guide below to edit \/ add questions to the quiz, create a quiz about the video game industry and share it with other people.<\/li><ol class=\"alpha\"><li>Navigate to the Data tab.<br\/><img src=\".\/images\/data_tab.png\" alt=\"data_tab.png\"\/><\/li><li>Find the “Questions” list and check the box next to it, so that it shows up in the GameStack window. <br\/><img src=\".\/images\/questions_checked.png\" alt=\"questions_checked.png\"\/><\/li><li>You will see a list of questions.

However, since there are 4 potential answers per question, they will not correspond in a 1 to 1 ratio. Instead, they will go in a 1 to 4 ratio: the 1st 4 multiple choice answers in the MultipleChoices list will be the choices for the 1st question in the Questions list. The 2nd 4 multiple choice answers (5-8) will be the answers for the 2nd question. The slots 9-12 will line up to the 3rd question in the Questions list, and so on. With all that considered, lets change the 1st 4 potential answers in the multiple choice list. In the MultipleChoices list, replace element 1 with “ruff”, element 2 with “meow”, element 3 with “quack” (the correct answer!), and element 4 with “chirp”.<br\/><img src=\".\/images\/questions_multiple_choices.png\" alt=\"questions_multiple_choices.png\"\/><\/li><li><b>Note that the answers in the MultipleChoices can not use punctuation marks (\"@#$';).<\/b><\/li><li> Click the green flag <img src=\".\/images\/gamestackflag.png\" alt=\"gamestackflag.png\"\/> and your new question will randomly be asked! <\/li><li> Change all of the questions to test the knowledge of your friends. <\/li><\/ol><\/ol><!--page:~~industry-terminology-exercise-stack~~-->","link":null,"mod":"industry-terminology","movie":null,"name":"industry-terminology-gamestack-exercise","promptfile":null,"prompts":null,"reference":null,"text":null,"title":"Game Stack Exercise"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":"","instructions":"<h1>Goal<\/h1><p>To demonstrate knowledge of major terms, acronyms, or software used in video game development.<\/p><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Choose a video game development tool or software discussed in this module, or one researched from the Internet.<\/li><li>Write a 4 - 5 paragraph essay that explains in detail what the purpose of the tool or software is used for in video game development.<\/li><li>Include explanations and detailed descriptions of at least three video game development terms or acronyms used in describing what the tool or software does.<\/li><li>Discuss the pros and cons of the tool or software.<\/li><\/ol><h1>Hints and Challenges<\/h1><p>Possible subjects could include a game engine like Unity, an art tool such as Photoshop, or source control software such as Github.

For the games they play, mechanics become second-nature. The purpose and function of each mechanic is easy for players to test and determine its value. From there, those who look deeper into what is making the mechanics work, start to understand and recognize the elements of game design at play. In that same regard, when we start to look very broadly at what makes up the principles of game design we start to see their origins in game theory.<\/p><p>Game theory touches on much more than just games and video games. It is used by economists, sociologists, mathematicians, and within many other fields of study. They are all studying how outcomes involving choice and action are affected by others with their own choices and actions. Given this broad position of study we can easily see how game theory can be used in endeavors such as business, social studies, science, and politics.<\/p><p>The idea of game theory could be traced back to The Art of War, by Sun Tzu, but John von Neumann is largely credited with formalizing game theory in modern times. Neumann was a mathematician who made a number of significant contributions in the field of mathematics in the 1930s and 1940s. He, in fact, created the field of game theory in academics as a study of math. His most famous contribution, in terms of today's video game design, was his minimax theorem, in which he showed certain choice patterns people would take if given the same information and the same set of choices. From his work, we get the very core basis of game design.<\/p><p>This module will attempt to give some understanding to what can become very complex and abstract concepts dealing with math and statistics. Not to worry, however, because we will explain these concepts as they align with our game design goals and demonstrate examples using familiar video games and other simplified scenarios.<\/p><p>In particular, we will cover these Topics in our discussion of game theory:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-theory-2\"> The Study of Strategic Decision Making<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-theory-3\"> Core Components of Game Theory<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-theory-4\"> Game Theory Examples in Video Games<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-theory-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Study of Strategic Decision Making <\/h1><p>Video games boast a wide variety of mechanics. Most gamers can easily tell if a first-person shooter has good controller reaction and if the button layout is appropriate or not. There is not much game theory happening in these functions. Skill in accuracy or button combos are not really in the realm of game theory. Game theory really comes into play when two (or more) people come into some kind of mutual competition for a goal. It is the interaction of people, decisions, and consequences that drives game theory and why it is so relevant to video game design.<\/p><p>We could call this the study of strategic decision making. We want to understand what the most likely outcomes are, and in particular, positive outcomes, when two or more entities are faced with the same or opposing challenges. In effect, we are trying to predict human behavior using mathematical models.<\/p><h3>The Prisoner's Dilemma<\/h3><p>As mentioned, this idea seems to be as old as warfare itself, becoming codified by Sun Tzu's Art of War and later quantified by von Neumann's mathematical models. The most famous model example of game theory is called The Prisoner's Dilemma. The scenario generally goes like this:<\/p><p>Two criminal partners have been caught robbing a bank. When they are arrested, they are immediately separated so that they cannot communicate with each other. They only know that both they and their partner are both in custody.<\/p><p>Each is offered the same plea bargain. Remain silent and go to trial or testify against the other and go free. If they both stay silent and go to trail, they will get 6 months of jail. However, if one is willing to be a witness against the other, that person will have their sentence reduced to no jail time, while the other person will get ten years of jail time. If both testify against the other, they both get five years in jail. Both of the accused are offered this deal at the same time, with no idea what the other person was offered.<\/p><p>This scenario creates what is known as a zero-sum game. With each “player” knowing the entire stakes of each choice they ask themselves, “what is the best course to maximize their own positive outcomes and minimize their own negative outcomes?” This is of course greatly complicated by the fact that another, thinking human is making the same decisions with the same thought process.<\/p><p>Consider in the prisoner's dilemma the two accused are, or were, partners. They worked together for their mutual benefit (forget for a moment that they were caught robbing a bank), but they don't have any real loyalty to one another. In addition, each knows they will not be able to influence the other's choice with threats or promises. So there is risk involved for any decision they may make. In fact, we have Conflict, Risk, Choices, and Consequences all hanging in the balance. And it is extremely well balanced.<\/p><p>So what do we expect game theory to tell us about this dilemma?<\/p><p>Since both of the accused are individual agents operating in their own self-interest, the more predicable choice is for each to betray the other. Of course, we can change the parameters of the dilemma to experiment with different outcome predictions. What if we changed the jail times for more slanted results? Would the outcome be as predictive if the jail time reduction for betrayal was a mere month? What if both of the accused have been in this situation before with each other and remember the negative consequences of a selfish choice? What if they keep playing the game ten times? Do they learn from their mistakes and make new choices at some point?<\/p><p>The Prisoner's Dilemma has many different facets and configurations that we, as game designers, can utilize to further understand game theory and how it is related to making balanced video games. It basically comes down to various mathematical configurations and models.<\/p><h3>Mathematical Models<\/h3><p>When we repeat these kind of experiments we start to create mathematical models of patterns of behavior. Mathematical models are very important in game theory and in video game design. We use them to create complex social and combat mechanics and AI interactions. We use them to create strategy scenarios in Real-Time Strategy games. And we use them to balance PvP strategy games of all sorts.<\/p><p>It really is a math equation with a human component. Mathematics is core to almost all game design as it relates to game theory. For the purposes of this course it is not necessary to display and explain all of the different ways to model game theory scenarios. It is, after all, not a math course. Rather we will seek to understand the overall concepts and allow those who want to, to further explore the detailed math models. What we will focus on is the concepts of strategy in game theory and how it relates to game design.<\/p><h3>The Science of Strategy<\/h3><p>Can people's thought processes and actions be reduced to a set of probability numbers like crafting the wing of an airplane? Do people function like foreseeable algorithms to the point of accurate predictability? In this case, we can only focus on two people where the “winner” only gains what the “loser” loses. It does not consider a host of other possible variations in human behavior, complexity, experience, or motivation. The truth is most things are much more complex than the Prisoner's Dilemma. What game theory really does is look how people choose solution strategies that have defined value over other solutions.<\/p><h3>The Nash Equilibrium <\/h3><p>In 1994, mathematician John Nash, who was the subject of the movie, A Beautiful Mind, won a Nobel Prize for his work on economics using game theory. Nash developed solution concepts as formal rules of how strategies will be adopted by people in states of competition. Specifically, the Nash Equilibrium states that each player is assumed to understand the optimal strategies of all other players, and that no one will gain by one competitor changing only their strategy. In other words, if all players have adopted a strategy that is the best strategy in relation to others strategies, we have an equilibrium. In a video game, this means a balance of strategy among all players, which is essential for good game design.<\/p><h3>Optimum Strategies <\/h3><p>The Prisoner's Dilemma does provide a simple basis to understand the concept of game theory as we add more complexity. It gives us baseline to identify optimum strategies. With the information to determine the best course of action optimum strategies are formed in the face of like competition. In kindergarten, we learned the Golden Rule: Do onto others as you would have others do onto you.  That is a statement that fits game theory as well: making choices that consider the actions of others is sound strategy.<\/p><h3>Dominant Strategies<\/h3><p>Looking again at the Prisoner's Dilemma, we see that the optimum strategy for the accused would be for both to refuse to testify. Game theory; however, suggest each person will instead choose a dominant strategy that is better for them. That is, the decision that has a strictly higher payoff for each prisoner's own self-interest separate from the other prisoner's self-interest. This, of course, is actually a poor strategy as it insures a less than optimum outcome for both prisoners.<\/p><p>The problem with dominant strategies in game design is that they present such a compelling choice; there is no reason to try any other strategy. They eliminate all other options as useless. If a game presents two strategies for victory, and one always dominates over the other, we might as well just remove the lesser strategy from the game. What we really want is mixed strategies, where no one strategy dominates all of the other options. This is not immediately intuitive and so we will practice iteration as a way of eliminating pure dominant strategies.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-theory-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Core Components of Game Theory<\/h1><p>For purposes of game design, we can simplify the application of game theory to four components: Players, Actions, Payoff, and Information. These core components are then the basis for the full rule set of a game.<\/p><h3>Player<\/h3><p>First we must define the players. For this discussion, we will assume that players are competing against each other and not playing a cooperative game. As a player they will assume that they are playing by the same rules as everyone else playing the game. That is, they have the same goals and strategies available to them (or at least a balance of resources and goal objectives). Game theory shows us that strategies change as more players are allowed to participate. For example, a one-on-one strategy card game becomes a very different experience when a third player joins.<\/p><h3>Actions<\/h3><p>Actions define what the players can do and when they can do them. Games usually structure a decision point where players will make choices. A common decision point in video games is a turn. That is, players each take a turn to declare decisions and take actions. Decision points can also be free form or simultaneous, which again, sets up a whole new set of strategy paths and outcomes.<\/p><h3>Payoff<\/h3><p>Payoff is next. The payoff for playing a video game is subjective, but generally involves a sense of self accomplishment or entertainment. Remember, players are likely to experience some defeat and frustration so there must be some intrinsic value to the art of playing the game itself. As game designers we manipulate this concept of payoff constantly in an attempt to achieve flow and fun. In other applications of game theory, payoff can be a much more serious component, as say in the Prisoner's Dilemma scenario or in creating economic policy.<\/p><h3>Information<\/h3><p>Our last component is Information. What does each player know as they start and play through the game? What do they not know at each stage of the game? Remember in the Prisoner's Dilemma the information the accused had was crucial to how they approached the problem. They both knew all the choices available to the other, but they did not know the decision on those choices the other would make. Changing any information, however, has a huge effect on the game. If the prisoners have faced a similar plea deal and know the previous outcome for testifying was less than optimal, that knowledge might play an important role in their decision the next time the scenario is presented.<\/p><p>Together, these essential components and the variations they can form help designers balance their game. These components combine to create a stable platform for games that can be functional and predictable. Yes, as game designers we do want some predictability. We don't want the game to be an exercise in predictability to the point of pointlessness, but we do need a certain amount of it in the rules so the game has stable structure. Players expect a level of consistency as they replay games over and over.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-theory-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Game Theory in Video Games <\/h1><p>As we have seen, game theory wasn't conceived for the purpose of making video games, but the concepts are a perfect match. From the simplest form of zero-sum games we can take and expand game theory to match the design strategies for most video games. Variety in games stems from how these concepts are presented, altered, or combined. We should be noticing a lot of crossover in these game theory concepts at this point. In this Topic, we will look at some specific game theory concepts and see how they are applied to some popular video games.<\/p><h3>Symmetric\/Asymmetric<\/h3><p>When we talk about symmetric vs asymmetric game design we are talking about different methods of achieving balance in game play. A symmetric design gives all players the exact same skills and resources. There is zero difference in the actions one player can take over another. Games in the Halo series fit a symmetric design: each player moves at the same speed; each player can take exactly the same amount of damage; and each player has the same access to the same set of skills and game options. In doing this, the designers have created perfect balance among players; at least in the sense of potential player vs player scenarios. Only skill at manipulating the controller separates one player's advantage at the game from another.<\/p><p>Asymmetric games also seek to ultimately balance player vs player but still offer some variety in playable characters. For most games like this, the skills and abilities of player characters are a series of benefits and tradeoffs. Let's look at Team Fortress 2 as an example of an asymmetric game design. In Team Fortress 2 each character class is slightly different. Some are faster with the tradeoff of having fewer hit points. Some have more powerful weapons with a tradeoff of being bigger targets. There are many combinations of benefits and penalties, but ultimately there is still balance. In essence, each benefit has a certain value that is countered by an equal penalty. This allows for many methods to victory while maintaining a fair and balanced experience.<\/p><h3>Cooperative\/Competitive<\/h3><p>With the rise of the Internet came MMO gaming and new ways to create games that are both cooperative and competitive on a grand scale. In general, cooperative games are games where people work together to find solutions to victory and competitive games are games where they work against each other to win.<\/p><p>In cooperative games, it is possible for all players to lose the game or for all players to win the game. While not a dedicated cooperative game, World of Warcraft has many cooperative elements. The best example is in the game's boss raids where perhaps dozens of players will gather with one goal in mind: defeat the boss or die trying. In this scenario, all the players must coordinate their attack together for an all or nothing fight to the finish. If the boss is defeated, everyone shares in the victory. If the boss is not defeated, everyone shares in the loss.<\/p><p>Most games, however, are designed to be competitive. Someone (or many players) will win and the rest will lose. There are countless examples of this premise such as any sports game or any game with player vs player elements. It is in these types of games game theory becomes so relevant and important in terms of creating strategies in a game that are balanced and yet are not exercises in pointlessness.<\/p><h3>Zero-sum\/Non Zero-sum<\/h3><p>Zero-sum games are ones in which one player's gains are directly related to another player's loss. Some zero-sum games provide what is called perfect information; that is, all players know all of the actions of the other players. While not strictly a video game, chess is a perfect example of a zero-sum game, where players have perfect knowledge of the other player's actions. Zero-sum games without perfect knowledge could include many Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games where one player's knowledge of the other player's actions may be limited by certain factors such as fog of war or lack of directly witnessing all of their actions. Extremely simple games such as Rock, Paper, Scissors are good examples of zero-sum games without perfect knowledge because the actions of all players are simultaneous and no one can accurately predict what an opponent will do. In addition, victory conditions are clear to all players with a single universal solution to achieving the goal of winning.<\/p><p>On the opposite side is Non Zero-sum games. In these games, there is no universal obviously accepted solution or destruction of resources. In many ways, non zero-sum game theory operates more like real life scenarios, so it makes sense that games that utilize non zero-sum game theory are mostly real-life simulation games like SimCity. Resource management does not necessarily permanently deplete resources and the games are generally non-competitive. Still, even simulation games do not completely stray from zero-sum concepts. Zoo Tycoon, for example has a money system that can eventually end the game because the player goes broke.<\/p><p>Pen and paper role playing games are the best examples of non zero-sum game theory. Players cooperate, they are not limited by a given set of solutions and the imaginary resources they can draw upon to solve problems are effectively, unlimited.<\/p><h3>Simultaneous\/Turn-based<\/h3><p>There are huge differences in game play when players take turns than when everyone takes simultaneous actions. In a game theory view, it is a difference of information available. In simultaneous play, information is constant, but a player must manage their own ability to take actions with their ability to track the actions of an opponent. In a turn-based game, players can stop and examine game information at a more relaxed pace.<\/p><p>Many RTS games use a turn-based system. Each player gets a turn to examine the known information in the game; army placements, available resources, etc. and then gets to react to these elements with little or no time constraints. Once the player takes all the actions they can or want, it is the next player's turn to do the same. Heroes of Might and Magic games are excellent examples of this.<\/p><p>Fighting games are good examples of simultaneous game theory in action. Each player chooses an attack or defensive move without any knowledge of what the opponent will do and all decisions are made at the same time. It is sort of like playing rock, paper, scissors, but with many more possible combinations. Knowledge of what the other play has done becomes irrelevant to what they will do next, and there is no way of knowing what they will do next. These are games of action and reaction with no time to ponder prior knowledge.<\/p><h3> Perfect Information\/Imperfect Information<\/h3><p>What a player knows is an important aspect of any video game structure. Having access to certain knowledge changes gameplay as that knowledge is added to or reduced. In game theory, this is divided into perfect knowledge and imperfect knowledge.<\/p><p>Games with perfect knowledge mean that all the players not only know the game structure and rules, they also have complete information on all events in the game that have previously occurred. For instance, in a game of chess, each player is witness to every move their opponent makes is a perfect knowledge game.<\/p><p>Heroes of Might and Magic is again a good example of a game of imperfect knowledge. Even though players take turns, the players do not see what their opponent is doing. They may see the results of their strategies (when their armies appear out of the fog of war) but they do not see the entire strategy or all of the actions the player is taking to claim victory.<\/p><p>From here we start to mix and match the above concepts, iterate on what works and what doesn't and soon come to some core strategies that have balance, purpose, and are fun to play.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~game-theory-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":".\/exercise\/DevProGameTheory_dodgeball.stack","instructions":"<h1>Goals<\/h1><ol><li>To learn, understand, and apply Game Theory concepts.<\/li><\/ol><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Click the <img src=\".\/images\/downloadbutton.png\" alt=\"layout.png\"\/> button at the top or bottom of this page to download the DevProGameTheory_dodgeball.stack file.<\/li><li>Save the file to a location you can access on your computer.<\/li><li>Click to open the file in Game Stack.<\/li><li>Run the game by clicking the green flag button <img src=\".\/images\/gamestackflag.png\" alt=\"gamestackflag.png\"\/><\/li><li><b> Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Characters <\/b><ol><li>For this section, we're going to modify some variables in GameStack to change from a symmetrical game to an asymmetrical game.<\/li><li>Navigate to the Design Tab.<br><\/br> <img src=\".\/images\/design_tab.png\" alt=\"design_tab.png\"\/><\/li><li>The two soldiers will be symmetrical by default.

The Game Design Document (GDD) is used by developers as a blueprint of the the game and holds all of the content, structure and details needed to plan the game's development from concept to release. In most video game development models the writing of a GDD will be the first step in making a game a reality.<\/p><p>Developing a complete and detailed GDD benefits game development in many ways. A meticulously detailed GDD allows the entire team to focus on one vision of the project. It sets clear goals and helps create schedules and production plans. It locks down gameplay and helps eliminate \"feature creep\". A complete GDD also provides a foundation to develop solid cost, time, and personnel estimates.<\/p><p>The Game Design Document is such an important document and tool in game development, it will be the focal point of the rest of the Game Design Section (Arcs 2-4). As we go through each Topic in this Module, we will begin the process of filling out our own GDD.<\/p><p>This Module will present a structure for creating original game concepts through various templates of a GDD. With a template chosen, we will begin to fully flesh out a GDD and by the end of this Section, we will have an official document presenting a complete game concept and development plan.<\/p><p>Covered in the Module are the following Topics:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-documentation-2\">Core Elements of a Game Design Document<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-documentation-3\">Variations on the GDD Structure<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-documentation-4\">Elements of a Technical Design Document<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a id=\"game-documentation-2\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Core Elements of a Game Design Document<\/h1><p>In Hollywood, a professional screenplay has a particular format that is considered \"industry standard\". The video game industry equivalent, the Game Design Document, is a much looser template that, so far, has no industry standard. That said, there are some core elements that, no matter how the document is structured, every GDD should have. The core GDD elements we will cover are as follows:<\/p><ul><li>Game Concept<\/li><li>Target Audience<\/li><li>Platform<\/li><li>Genre<\/li><li>Core Gameplay<\/li><li>Visual Style<\/li><li>Characters<\/li><li>Story<\/li><\/ul><p>Each of these sections can be placed into the GDD as the game designer sees fit. Some may find a Game Design Document template is much easier to implement as it will offer a structure for the order and organization of these topics. How this sections are written individually will be much more important than their exact order in the GDD.<\/p><h3>Game Concept<\/h3><p>Let's start filling in our GDD with the most crucial first question: What is the game? Before a game can be made, we have to decide what the game is (and is not). First and foremost, the game concept must connect to an audience. Right now, this audience is not legions of dedicated fans, but instead our own development team: we must write a concept that intrigues and captures the imagination of the team.<\/p><p>Typically this information will be placed in a very early section of a GDD, perhaps even on the first page. Our GDD template we selected for our exercises calls this section \"Game Concept\".<\/p><p>This section does not have to lay out much in the way of gameplay or mechanics. That will come later. For now, the idea is to create excitement over the general theme and concept of the game. Let's build an example game so that we can see a demonstration on how this information might fit into the GDD.<\/p><p>Example GDD: Game Concept for <em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Logo_TemperedSteel.jpg\" alt=\"Logo_TemperedSteel\" width=\"591\" height=\"317\" \/><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>It is the Age of Steel on the young world of Raan. Crusades against a rising dragon threat in the North has left the Human Empire of Rahaan without a king, and in his absence, a corrupt aristocracy has risen to power. As Lords and Ladies of the countryside are stripped of title and land, a Civil War erupts between noble knights seeking to hold the peace and greedy warlords out for conquest. Into this conflict, you are cast as nobility trying to rise to power in these violent times. As you build your castle and the loyalty of your people, tough decisions will have to be made: will you side with the warmongers bent on destruction and chaos, defend the traditions of Empire, or perhaps just profit from the war, selling mercenaries and resources to the highest bidder?<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>Set in the original fantasy world of Raan, players will find themselves immersed in a vast conflict full of conquest, diplomacy and wonder. As they build and expand their kingdoms, players can establish their legacy in the history of the world.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/strong><strong><em> is an online, free-to-play title and is supported by our unique in-game microtransactions system. Players can purchase intricately balanced boosts and upgrades, to speed up or increase resources to help in all aspects of the game. As a free-to-play game, Tempered is carefully designed for all players: from beginners to gaming enthusiasts, warmongers to tradesmen, every player can enjoy all aspects of play without paying a single dime.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Target Audience<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_demographics.jpg\" alt=\"image_demographics\" width=\"670\" height=\"401\" \/><p>It cannot be stressed enough that if there is no audience for a game, it will not be successful no matter how new and innovative it is. Entire studios can fall when they fail to target a particular demographic that is thriving and able to consume the products being created for them. Market researcher should be utilized to identify an audience and create a desire for the product through marketing to that audience. Finally, in the Target Audience section of our GDD, we will also announce the ESRB rating the game is targeting.<\/p><p>Example GDD: Target Audience for <em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel will target an audience of male and female gamers, ages 14-35. In particular, the game will market to gamers with interest and background in fantasy settings of magic and mystery; fantasy role-playing games (FRPGs) and real-time battle simulations. This game assumes basic equality of people where issues of race and gender are not part of the politics of the world. Tempered Steel contains no graphic depictions of violence, no blood and no suggestive themes. It will seek a general ESRB rating appropriate for TEEN audiences.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Platform<\/h3><p>There are many different platforms we can develop our game to be played on. Gaming platforms include: home gaming consoles (Xbox One, Playstation 4, etc.); the Personal Computer (PC) market; phone and tablet Apps; Web browser-based games; and more. We can also decide to develop the game for multiple platforms if that is technologically and financially viable for our release plans.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_platforms.png\" alt=\"image_platforms\" width=\"809\" height=\"306\" \/><p>There are a lot of considerations when choosing a platform. What is our target audience? What ESRB (or similar system if distributing outside North America) rating are we aiming for? What platform best utilizes the core gameplay? Still, this section is little more than a couple sentences.<\/p><p>Example GDD: Platform for <em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel is an epic browser-based web game that will be available on PC, smartphones, and tablets. It will target an audience of males, ages 14-35 and will seek a general ESRB rating appropriate for TEEN audiences.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Genre<\/h3><p>Here we will decide on our genre (see Section One: Arc One: Module: History of the Video Game Industry for a full discussion on Genres). This is just a brief sentence in our GDD, but it is important to list as it will create a tone and methodology on our approach to that particular genre.<\/p><p>Example GDD: Genre for <em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS), fantasy war MMO that focuses on resource management, castle building, and massive troop combat. <\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Core Gameplay<\/h3><p>In this section of the GDD we will describe how the game is played and list all of the core mechanics. Different GDDs will present this information in different ways. One way is to write level abstractions. Level abstractions are snippets of full level designs. It could be a detailed description of the first minute of playing the game or a broad summery of actual gameplay elements. As we fill out these sections, more detail can be added as we go through the Section. For the purpose of the example GDD we are constructing, we stay broad with our description of gameplay. For a complete GDD, all gameplay elements will eventually have to be formulated and documented here. We can, however, begin to break our broad elements into smaller “aspects” such as combat, puzzles, exploration, etc.<\/p><p>Example GDD: Core Gameplay for <em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel will feature these core gameplay elements:<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>City Customization<\/em><\/strong><em> – <strong>Build an Empire with over 25 buildings, equipped with upgraded levels and research. <\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>Practice Ancient Strategies and Tactics<\/em><em> – Use medieval war tactics to outsmart and outwit your enemies by creating a unique blend of military units, choosing from over 15 unit types and 10 or more heroes that can quickly sway the tide of battle in your favor.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>A Hero's Journey<\/em><em> &#8211; Venture into Dungeons and fight challenging bosses to find weapons and armor and gain experience so your heroes can successfully lead their soldiers into battle. <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>Explore the Marketplace <\/em><em>- Become a traveling merchant in a state of the art Marketplace with unprecedented, real money, trading features.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>Form Alliances<\/em><em> – Explore the many varieties of alliances and coalitions where new friends and neighbors can join together in the battle over land and resources.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Visual style<\/h3><p>Here we will describe what the game will look like. If we are not yet sure what it will look like, we can begin to breakdown our concept's most obvious environments to get us started. For instance, what the world looks like is already contained in our chosen level environments. Some possible environment choices might be:<\/p><ul><li>A post-apocalyptic wasteland<\/li><li>A 2D neon maze filled with “breadcrumb” dots<\/li><li>The ruins of a lost magical civilization<\/li><li>An asteroid field in the middle of deep space<\/li><li>A deep, dark dungeon<\/li><\/ul><p>We can also consider environmental effects as a way of brainstorming our game's look. Consider these environmental effects or weather patterns as visual clues to the game:<\/p><ul><li>Constant storms cause unnatural red lightning to crash to the earth<\/li><li>Volcanoes erupt in the background<\/li><li>Torch light illuminates the dark cave<\/li><\/ul><p>Example GDD: Visual Style for<em> Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_TemperedSteel_visualstyle.png\" alt=\"image_TemperedSteel_visualstyle\" width=\"952\" height=\"544\" \/><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel exist in an original fantasy world called Raan. The game depicts a wide landscape of open fields, castles, and natural terrain from a top-down point of view. In particular, Tempered Steel will feature:<\/em><\/strong><\/p><ul><li><strong><em>Natural Terrain<\/em><\/strong><em> -<strong> Mountains, rivers, hills, plains, forests<\/strong><\/em><\/li><li><strong><em>Unnatural Terrain<\/em><em> – Ruins, dungeons, fields of fire<\/em><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><em>Human Constructions – <\/em><em>Castles, farms, quarries, mines, towers<\/em><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><em>Characters –<\/em><em> warriors, workers, heroes, lords<\/em><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><em>Items –<\/em><em> crowns, weapons, siege engines<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul><h3>Characters<\/h3><p>Here we will delve into the characters in the game. Although it is not always intuitive, almost all games have characters. Even a game as simple as Pac-Man has amazingly detailed characters when we think about it. Each ghost has a distinctive personality and habit when in the maze. Even Pac-Man himself seems to have a personality (So reckless with those cherries!). In general, this section will have detailed descriptions of all the game's characters, including personality, quirks and physical descriptions. Later in this Section, we will take a detailed look at how to formulate exciting and original characters for video games, but for now, we can examine our example from <em>Tempered Steel<\/em>.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_characters.png\" alt=\"image_characters\" width=\"758\" height=\"303\" \/><p>Example GDD: Characters for <em>Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>Tempered Steel features family noble houses that players will choose and guide through the events of the game. They include:<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>House Gregor –<\/em><em> The only legitimate land holders outside of the main city of Point Glory, this family is set up with the best of material defenses. Beset on all sides, their numbers remain low, but their castle and blessing from the Lost King makes them formidable in this time of civil war. Their standard is the White and Silver Ice Dragon on the Black Field. <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>House Latomere –<\/em><em> One of the families jockeying for power in the lands outside Point Glory, these people are born fighters. They employ guerilla tactics whenever possible, and close quarters fighting always. Their standard is the green tiger on the yellow field.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><ul><li><strong><em>Flint Latomere<\/em><em>: Son of the patriarch, the Knight of Knives. He wears light armor and fights with two daggers rather than a broadsword. He is the first to desire land after the Gregors are given theirs, and immediately builds a keep uncomfortably close to the Gregors stronghold.<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><strong><em>House Ptollack<\/em><em> – Water faring people from the dock ward in Point Glory that were aiding in the construction of the great bridge (half finished by game time) but left when they saw their opportunity to hold land. They set up by the coast, and are good with trade and water warfare. Their standard is the Green Shark on the Blue Plane.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><ul><li><strong><em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sammy Ptollack:<\/em><em> The Knight of Coral. She leaves the dock ward with her own contingent by way of sea, and settles in Gregor lands along the coast, spotting it with small castles and keeps, almost like luxuriant medieval coastal condos. She regularly trades with Point Glory, and is thus best equipped, though she fares best on the water.<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><strong><em>House Gentler –<\/em><em> A powerful clan, but clunky. Their specialty is the large technologies of war, like siege engines and battering rams. It takes a long time for them to gear up for war, but they are almost unstoppable when they are ready to fight.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Story<\/h3><p>As mentioned in Characters, it can be quite surprising how much story even simple games have. There is a story in Pac-Man. There is a story in Angry Birds and there is certainly a story in Halo. Some games will obviously have more story than others. Here we will detail our plot, any scripted sequences, and any cinematics or cut-scenes that will be in the game. Again, when we reach the Story Topic in the Section, we will return to this section with greater detail and understanding of what to put here. For now, let's continue with our Tempered Steel example.<\/p><p><em>Example GDD: Story for Tempered Steel<\/em><\/p><p><strong><em>“The King is gone! Long live the Red Queen!”<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>For centuries the Great and Ageless King Rahaan II ruled Raan with an even hand and an open heart. With his marriage to his seventh wife, Asha-Mon, all that changed. Some say the young queen controlled the King's will. Some say she used magic and enchanted the King from the beginning. Whatever the circumstances, the Queen has sent the King and his forces to the North to battle the awakened dragons. As the game opens, the King has been gone for a decade, and as the newly titled Red Queen consolidates her power, loyalists to the missing king rise and start a rebellion. Tempered Steel takes place during a civil war as players take on the roles of powerful house leaders who must choose sides and prepare for war. From here, the story will be told by the players themselves as the fate of the land is solely determined by the actions of the players.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h3>Sound<\/h3><p>Much like the visual elements, we should be able to instantly conceive some of the sounds of our game world.

Rather, most are written in a style or format that best describes the particular game assigned to it. In that regard, all GDDs are always custom to the project. Given that, it is still a good idea to look at and consider the merits of other GDD templates.<\/p>&nbsp;<h3>Why Be Different?<\/h3><p>The problem with every game using the same GDD structure is that it begins to create homogeny (or sameness) in game design.  While this can be a good thing in terms of evenness and consistency, it can stifle creativity.  In addition, because of the massive diversity in game designs and styles, it will often be the case that one particular layout of a GDD just fits a certain genre better than another. When choosing a GDD template it is best to consider the game we want to make and choose a template that best implements that style of design. In particular, we want to focus on platform, genre, and mechanical considerations when choosing a GDD template.<\/p><h3>Platform Considerations<\/h3><p>The platform we choose for the game could have an affect on the Game Design Document template we want to use. Remember, the platform is the system or format the game is played on. Each platform has it's own issues, benefits and complications that can be highlighted with a proper fitting GDD template. Perhaps the template has extensive sections for controller actions. Or perhaps, if we are making a game for mobile devices, it would be convenient to have sections on microtransactions or expanded content. The point is, choosing a template made for a simple game is not going to work well for a large complex game.<\/p><h3>Genre Considerations<\/h3><p>So how do genre considerations affect our GDD template? Well, certain templates will be better suited for laying out certain genre gameplay elements. For example, a MMO RPG might need a lot of sections on character options such as classes and skill trees. In this case, we would choose a GDD style that clearly presented sections on these elements instead of a very basic GDD template for a 2D platform jumper.<\/p><h3>Mechanical Considerations<\/h3><p>Much like the other considerations, gameplay has the same needs for a properly formatted GDD. Simple games with few play options don't need a GDD template built to organize a massive amount of mechanics, and in reverse, we don't want to chose a simple GDD template for a game with a lot of complexity.<\/p><p>Every Game Design Document is unique. It doesn't really matter what template we chose because the document's format will eventually be adjusted to fit the needs of the game and the development team. It will certainly be easier to choose a template that most closely fits the platform, genre and mechanics early on, but there will so much iteration and documentation that, in the end, all GDDs are custom.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"game-documentation-4\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Elements of a Technical Design Document<\/h1><p>Although for the purpose of this Game Design Curriculum we will not fully examine the Technical Design Document, it is still important to understand its function. The Technical Design Document (TDD) is a companion to the GDD. Where the GDD documents the gameplay, plot and visuals of the game, the TDD expresses the actual technical components that will make the game work. These components broadly include:<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_flowchart.png\" alt=\"image_flowchart\" width=\"1165\" height=\"547\" \/><h3>Software<\/h3><p>As discussed in the Industry terminology Module, there are many software options to help build and implement a game on a platform, or multiple platforms. These are the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software and the Software Development Kits (SDKs) among many other that can be a great boon to the development process.<\/p><h3>Hardware<\/h3><p>Deciding on what hardware to develop a game on is another important decision for the TDD. There is usually a cost\/benefit assessment to be done with considering what quality of hardware will be needed for the project.<\/p><h3>Programming Language<\/h3><p>Choosing the most efficient and workable programming language for the project is perhaps the most important decision any development team will make.<\/p><h3>Engine<\/h3><p>This is separate from software because although every project will utilize some software, not every game will require or want to use a game engine. Later in this curriculum, we will more closely examine game engines and how they can help a project.<\/p><h3>Data Sharing<\/h3><p>This is another technical element that may not cross the mind of the typical game designer as he\/she contemplates world domination as a game maker. Data sharing requires high-tech systems that are fully described in the TDD.<\/p><h3>Sound Software<\/h3><p>Different than what the game will sound like, this section in the TDD describes the instruments or software that will be utilized to actually create the sound effects and music.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~game-documentation-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":".\/exercise\/DevProFreebird.stack","instructions":"<h1>Goals<\/h1><ol><li>Learn how to build the point-and-click adventure game Freebird by starting with the template version of the game.<\/li><li>Learn about how Game Stack layers its sprites, lock sprites in place, and allow sprites to pass through their mouse clicks to the sprites underneath.<\/li><\/ol><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Click the <img src=\".\/images\/downloadbutton.png\" alt=\"layout.png\"\/> button at the top or bottom of this page to download the DevProFreebird.stack file.<\/li><li>Save the file to a location you can access on your computer.<\/li><li>Click to open the file in Game Stack.<\/li><li>Open the Templates tab:<p>Note that when you open the DevProFreebird.stack file the Freebird stage is selected, and the Sprites area is empty.

This drawing order is known as layers, with each sprite on its own layer. While most of sprites in the Freebird game take care of their own layer management, some of them do not. By building each of our sprites in back-to-front order, and then locking them in place, we won't need to concern ourselves with how layers work. For this step we start with the sprite that needs to be at the backmost layer, which is the curtain the cat is hiding behind.<\/p><ol class=\"alpha\"><li>In the Templates tab, scroll down to the bottom and click on the T_Curtain template sprite.<\/li><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/gamedocumentation-curtainsprite.png\" alt=\"layout.png\"\/><li>Right click the T_Curtain template sprite and select 'new sprite'.

It is the use of characters that allow us to become immersed in a story by placing ourselves in their shoes. For movies, we watch the character as an outside observer, however, in video games, we are the character and interact with the world as a participant. In this module, we will briefly explore all aspects of creating characters for video games including building personalities and motivations, interaction with Non-Player Characters, dialog and how character and story interact. In the following sub-modules, we will take a detailed look at each of these broad topics.<\/p><p><strong>Creating Characters<\/strong><\/p><p>There are all sorts of ways of breaking down characters. However you do it, what is generally the result is the trinity of Archetype Vs. Stereotype Vs. 3-Dimensional Being. Far too often in games an archetype devolves into a stereotype and 3-Dimensional characters are left for the sequel. That is not to say the archetype and the stereotype have no place in games, however, the general overuse of such character types needs to stop taking the place of a more well-rounded and compelling antagonist or protagonist.  The trick in doing so is being original with your characters.<\/p><p><strong>What is an NPC?<\/strong><\/p><p>Unique to games is the concept of an NPC or a Non-Player Character. In film, all characters are basically NPCs. That is to say, the audience as no control over their actions. In a game, a player typically takes the role of a major protagonist within the story and has control over their actions. Every other character in the game that is not under the direct control of a living player is a Non-Player Character. As a writer, each of these characters should serve a purpose to the plot or environment of the game.<\/p><p><strong>What is a Character Arc?<\/strong><\/p><p>Characters (and for that matter, NPCs) need to evolve with the story. The changes in a character that are afflicted by the story is call the Character Arch. Consider for a second your favorite characters in games and film. Are they the same person at the beginning of the story as at the end? Characters that begin perfect are boring. Even stoic characters such as Master Chief from Halo have character arches.<\/p><p><strong>Using Dialog in Games<\/strong><\/p><p>Dialog is a writer's best tool. It allows for character and story to be revealed to the player in a way that feels natural. It allows for plot points to be explained and it gives characters personality and life. However, using dialog in a game is much different than a movie or a television show. Video game dialog has its own rules and tricks that every game writer should be aware of.<\/p><p><strong>Character Driven Plots<\/strong><\/p><p>The plot of any game should be driven by the actions of the player character(s). Good writing and game structure will work to create the player as the Universal Driver of plot, character motivation and story. That is, every action the player takes creates reactions and new choices for the player.<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#character-2\">Character Types in Games<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#character-3\">Using Non-Player Characters<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#character-4\">The Character Arc<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#character-5\">Character Dialog<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"character-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Character Types in Games<\/h1><p>Games offer an amazing variety of characters. From the cute to the monstrous, games present an unprecedented freedom in character creation than any medium before it. Unfortunately, many characters still lack dimension and many fall to stereotypes. In this sub-module we will examine the different types of characters found in various genres of games and discuss how they breakdown as archetypes, stereotypes or actual 3-dimensional characters.<\/p><h3>What is an Archetype?<\/h3><p>Archetypes are broad categories of character types. Often their characteristics are drawn from mythology or the more modern concept of “The journey of the Hero” as illustrated by the likes of Joseph Campbell and others. In film, perhaps no other movie better exemplifies the journey of the hero than Star Wars. Here, each character is an archetype that fits into the hero's journey. See if you can identify from Star Wars: The Hero; The Sword Master; the trickster; and others.<\/p><p>Video games have created their own character archetypes. Here are some examples:<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_stoichero.png\" alt=\"image_stoichero\" width=\"1027\" height=\"515\" \/><p><strong>The Stoic Warrior Archetype:<\/strong> With grim determination, the stoic warrior faces impossible odds with a quip and a full metal jacket. Cold and emotionless on the surface, he is actually deeply invested in good winning out over evil. Example: Master Chief in <em>Halo<\/em>.<\/p><p><strong>The Damsel in Distress Archetype<\/strong>: Representing the best the world has to offer, the Precious will be the target of evil and the driving motivation for the Hero. Example: Zelda from <em>Legend of Zelda.<\/em><\/p><h3>What is a Stereotype?<\/h3><p>It can be hard to separate an archetype from a stereotype. In fact, archetypes become stereotypes when the broad personality trait of the archetype becomes the entirety of their character. That is to say, the writer stopped developing the character beyond filling in the expected traits. This creates flat characters that are predictable, unoriginal and boring.<\/p><p>Stereotypes fail because of clichés. Clichés are the building blocks for stereotypes and they happen when lazy writers fail to attempt fully developed 3-Dimensional characters. Here are some examples of how Archetypes become Stereotypes:<\/p><p><strong>The Stoic Hero Stereotype: <\/strong>With a heartless exterior, he kills without care and without depth of conscious. The one-liner is his true calling card, not the deeds he accomplishes. What at first seems cool, quickly becomes crass. Example: Marcus Fenix from <em>Gears of War<\/em>.<\/p><p><strong>The Damsel in Distress Stereotype<\/strong>: She is the key to a bright future but no one knows why. It might just be because the artist made her so beautiful. In any regard, her purpose is to be a victim for the hero to save and nothing more. Example: Princess Peach from <em>Mario Bros.<\/em><\/p><h3><strong>Building 3-Dimensional Characters<\/strong><\/h3><p>Writers should be wary of shortcuts in character creation. Simply checking off archetype character traits is a fast way to making a stereotype. What the goal really is: is to make an original, compelling character no one has quite seen before. That doesn't mean archetype traits need to be thrown out. It simply means that something new needs to be added. Something that either plays off expected clichés in a unique way or creates some contradictions of the archetype itself. In general, for every character, think of one thing that contradicts or redefines the stereotype and make that a feature trait of the character.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_3dimensionalhero.png\" alt=\"image_3dimensionalhero\" width=\"696\" height=\"522\" \/><p><strong>The 3-Dimensional Stoic Hero:<\/strong> Viewed by most as a hero of the people, he does what must be done to save humanity. Taking on himself to commit the violence necessary to save the world, he makes the sacrifices needed so that others can hold to their innocence.  However, he must constantly face the real truth of his actions: that he is slipping into the very madness he defends against. Fortunately for our hero, the voices in his head aren't entirely humorless.<\/p><p><strong>The 3-Dimensional Damsel in Distress: <\/strong>She carries the burden of the kingdom on her narrow shoulders. Growing up in the royal family, she has seen firsthand the moral and intellectual laziness of her kin. Casting away childish dreams of handsome princes and fancy ballroom galas she has dedicated herself to being a just ruler. However, her rejection of cultural superstitions as ostracized from the common people, even as her focus on reason and logic pulls them out of the dark ages of the past.<\/p><p>As we see in these examples, we now have a few new character elements to play with when expanding these characters' arcs. Each retains the core personality of the archetype, removes a cliche that would create a stereotype and adds a new trait to play with to begin to build a 3-dimensional character. Of course, this is just the bare minimum treatment for a character. It does however begin to lead to something new and original.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"character-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Using Non-Player Characters (NPCs)<\/h1><p>In many video games, players take on the role of a character that then interacts with other characters in the world. Every single character (whether human, monster or something else) not under the control of a player is a Non-Player Character, otherwise known as a NPC.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_characters1.png\" alt=\"image_characters\" width=\"758\" height=\"303\" \/><h3>Purpose of NPCs<\/h3><p>NPCs are tools used to tell the player the story, to interact with the player as enemies and allies and to give a game world depth and a feeling of being alive and full of things happening. NPCs are most closely associated with Role-Playing Games, but in fact, NPCs are in almost any game where other beings inhabit the same screen as the player character's avatar. Through dialog interaction NPCs can reveal plot points, give quests and rewards, and even serve as red herrings and foils to solving the game. In all, they are some of the best tools game writers can use to advance their story and game through its various levels and stages. NPCs can also add flavor and tone to a game. Their inclusion does not have to reveal core plot points or give directions to quests. They can also be used to help paint a better picture of the setting and world. Most NPCs in a game, however, are obstacles to be overcome. Whether they are cute little kitties or malicious super-intelligent mushrooms, if they are not under the control of a player, they are all NPCs.<\/p><h3>Creating NPCs<\/h3><p>Non-Player Characters deserve the same care and depth in their creation as any player character does. The rules are the same and good results benefits the entire game. One thing to remember is that in a video game, the interaction of NPCs with the hero and the game itself is just as important as their role in the story. For example, movies will often cut from the hero's quest to show the audience what the villain is up to. While video game cutscenes can do this too, there are other ways, better ways, to build a villain in games.<\/p><h3>Using NPCs<\/h3><p>Most NPCs will interact with a player in one or more of these ways:<\/p><ol><li><strong>As Informants:<\/strong> Here the NPC merely speaks to the player or speaks of the world, either directly or in a cutscene. NPCs can also be scripted to have conversations with players. The most common version of this is in the decision tree dialog format. Here the game focuses on a conversation with a NPC, giving the player dialog options that, in turn, offer the player information or choices. <em>Fallout 3<\/em> and <em>Skyrim<\/em> are great examples of dialog tree games, while any <em>Halo<\/em> game will have its share of story driven cutscenes.<\/li><\/ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>As Obstacles:<\/strong> In this example the NPCs purpose is not to inform, but to intercept. These are the hordes of enemies the hero must defeat in his quest to save the world. They can be anything from fodder to bosses to the Big Bad, but they are all NPCs.<\/li><\/ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>As Background:<\/strong> The purpose of this type of NPC is just to make the world seem bigger and more fully realized. It is often not necessary or even possible to completely interact with these NPCs. Their purpose is to make the market seem less empty or to add color and complexity to a city scene. The player will typically know to ignore them, but they add to the illusion of a real, functioning location teeming with life and activity.<\/li><\/ol><ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>All In One:<\/strong> Of course, NPCs can be any mix of these elements. Consider the dark stranger sitting quietly in the back of the tavern. His presence alone creates a sense of unease and intrigue. Then imagine the player approaches and starts a conversation through a dialog tree. This could lead to a quest, or perhaps a full on bar fight.<\/li><\/ol><h3><strong>Creating Items as Characters<\/strong><\/h3><p>Often it will be required to describe or write about inanimate objects or items found within a game. There is no good reason why items cannot have the same rich backgrounds and stories that characters do.<\/p><p>Below is a description for a futuristic hi tech device that allows the user to see enemies through walls and other obstacles. The goal is to create something fantastic that nevertheless seems plausible and acceptable within the context of the game.<\/p><p><strong>Item Example: Dimensional Shift Goggles<\/strong><\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/Goggles.png\" alt=\"Goggles\" width=\"739\" height=\"457\" \/><p>These heavy eye goggles are made of large copper dials surrounding thick amber lenses with a nylon head strap. Various spin dials, levers, lenses and adjustment gauges cover the alien looking device. Its technology is based partly on M Theory, which became fact after a particle accelerator accident tore a rip in space\/time creating \"The First Incursion.\" As best could be understood, core universal vibration anomalies caused Earth's dimension to \"touch\" another and alien monstrosities poured forth. Government scientists quickly began reverse engineering alien weapons captured from the invaders but found them completely bizarre and impossible to make function. That is until they integrated ancient mysticism in the form of Babylonian glyphs carved into the lenses. Now they work, but scientists still don't know why. In theory, they operate by changing the wearer's eye and brain vibrations to sync with an alien dimension. This includes seeing into the ethereal, a ghost-like plane of translucence. The end effect of this is the ability to see through solid objects, however the process of using the goggles is extremely painful and may cause lasting damage if worn too long.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"character-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Character Arc<\/h1><h3>What is a Character Arc?<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_characterarc1.png\" alt=\"image_characterarc1\" width=\"354\" height=\"529\" \/><p>A character arc represents the core physical and emotional changes a character goes through in the course of pursuing their quest. Looking at it in another way, they are fundamentally different personalities at the end of the quest than they were when it began.<\/p><h3>Who needs a Character Arc?<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_characterarc2.png\" alt=\"image_characterarc2\" width=\"793\" height=\"466\" \/><p>Does Mario have a character arc in <em>Mario Bros<\/em>? Does his quest change him in fundamental ways as he moves closer to victory? How about Link in the Zelda games? The simple answer is “not really.” Mario is single-mindedly obsessed with one thing and nothing tossed at him will deter him from moving ever forward to completing his quest. For these games, gameplay would be slowed and circumvented with an emphasis on character development. The fun is in the game mechanics, and little thought has been given to character development beyond their initial creation as cute screen characters. And it works fine for this type of game.<\/p><p>Many games are not concerned with character arcs. In most first-person shooter games, the player interacts with the world always in the same mindset: kill anything that moves. In these games, developing finger skills takes precedence over character development. It doesn't matter how you got into the arena of death, it only matters that you start shooting things. Some shooters, such as Halo, tag on a storyline that you can follow or not while honing your skills killing aliens. The story, and any character arcs (however cool they may be), are merely extras, to be taken or discarded as the player sees fit.<\/p><h3>Character Arc as Game Mechanics<\/h3><p>Role-Playing Games take their story, and in turn, their characters much deeper into the play experience. For most RPGs the entirety of the game is one gigantic character arc for the player. Often this is accompanied by statistics that demonstrate the long-term growth of the character thought out the game. Levels, Ability Stats and Growth of Strength and Power are examples of this.<\/p><h3>Story Arcs<\/h3><p>Story is often a large part of RPGs and so allows for other kinds of character arcs than just a rise in power and stats. Often this returns to the Hero's Journey in some way and involves epic trials and tribulations for the hero that can alter his outlook of his quest many times before achieving victory and resolution.<\/p><p><em>Fallout 3<\/em> demonstrates the story arc perfectly. By the end of the game, the player has made choices that guided his character on a path of a hero or an anti-hero and these choices have ripple effects on how NPCs interact with the character.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"character-5\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Character Dialog<\/h1><p>There are three ways to express character in a video game: how they look: what they do; and what they say. Expressing character through visuals is the job of the game artist. Their clothing, posture, and physical appearance are all indications of character. Demonstrating what they do often results in determining their motivations (they want to kill you) in obvious ways. However, for story development and insight into personality, dialog is the tool of the trade.<\/p><h3>What Makes Good Dialog?<\/h3><p>Good dialog seamlessly blends character and story together as one while bad dialog can rip a player from immersion in the world quicker than mom calling you for dinner. Good dialog is sharp, clever and thoroughly convinces the audience the characters and conversation are real and not just there to tell them something. Most of all, good dialog advances the story and character arcs while burying the exposition (see below).<\/p><h3>Purpose of Dialog<\/h3><p>When it comes down to it, each piece of dialog should have a purpose. This purpose can include:<\/p>    <ol>        <li><strong>Character development:<\/strong> Characters speak to convey to the audience some core truth or flaw of the character. It sets up where the character is so that we can later tell where he has been.<\/li>    <\/ol>    <ol start=\"2\">        <li><strong>Story Development:<\/strong> There are core plot points that need to be explained to the audience or initiated through dialog.<\/li>    <\/ol>    <ol start=\"3\">        <li><strong>World Development:<\/strong> Although it does not advance character or story, it fills in the blanks of the world for greater immersion.<\/li>    <\/ol>    <ol start=\"4\">        <li><strong>Comic Relief:<\/strong> The tone of the world needs a temporary reprieve to allow the audience to breathe and relax for a moment before intensity levels rise again.<\/li>    <\/ol><h3>Burying the Exposition<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_buryingtheexposition.png\" alt=\"image_buryingtheexposition\" width=\"826\" height=\"424\" \/><p>The most crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of relating information to the audience through dialog is burying the exposition. Exposition is all the details your audience needs to know to understand character motivation and how the plot is advancing. All too often, this information is simply blurting out the moment the player needs to know it. It may be a functional way of telling a story but it not a very clever or immersive way to do it. In fact, it can rip your audience right out of the story you are telling. It starts when characters start speaking of things they already know as if they are saying them for the very first time just for the sake of the audience hearing it. The crucial points are laid out on the surface of the conversation as if the characters are having the conversation exclusively for the benefit of the audience.<\/p><p>A better way is to “bury” the information within what appears to be a natural conversation between characters. This can take some practice but what you want to achieve is informing the audience of what you want to know without them realizing that was the intent all along. Instead, what they experienced was a captivating scene of authentic character dialog that held them emotionally while at the same time, informed them of how the scene advances the story.<\/p>&nbsp;<p><strong>Dialog in Video Games<\/strong><\/p><p>There are some crucial differences when writing dialog for games as opposed to writing a movie or television script. In film, the audience exclusively interacts with the story through dialog and visuals. In games, dialog often sets up gameplay through instructions or quests that lead to interactions with the game. What this means is the player has chosen to play a game in part, at least, because they want the gameplay aspects more than they want to just sit and watch.<\/p><p>For video game dialog, less is more. The longer a player must listen to a dialog or read text, the longer they are being kept from doing what they actually want to do: playing the game. Long tracts of dialog are boring if mandatory. The trick is often learning how to express more in the briefest amount of time and words possible. Only when characters are completely fleshed out as 3-Dimensional characters is this possible and workable.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"character-6\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Character Creation Sample<\/h1><p><strong>Character Examples<\/strong><\/p><p>Here are three character examples draw from simple, three-word design requirements. Think of them as characters at the start of a sci-fi horror game. The idea is to create enough background and character quirks to play off within the game.<\/p><p><strong>Character 1 - earnest, focused, full of fire <\/strong><\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/KeiraNicolson.png\" alt=\"KeiraNicolson\" width=\"309\" height=\"494\" \/><p>KEIRA NICOLSON (age 22); Keira is a young, attractive, college athlete and captain of her Lacrosse team. Focusing on her career and personal goals rather than dating, Keira keeps her hair short and is fond of wearing oversized sweatshirts with a Lacrosse logo. Keira chooses to still live at home with her mom and younger sister.<\/p><p><strong>Character 2 - no-nonsense, tough ex-military, heart of gold <\/strong><\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/FrankObenchain.png\" alt=\"FrankObenchain\" width=\"309\" height=\"494\" \/><p>FRANK OBENCHAIN (age 54); Frank is large man, who still remains fit for his age. His hair is grey, and even though receding, Frank still manages a slight flat-top haircut. Frank was a special ops marine for almost twenty years until his alcoholism and a tragic accident killed his daughter. Today, Frank is ten years sober, has no family and works as a school janitor. He often wears tight t-shirts that show off his semper fi tattoo. The name \"Lulu\" is tattooed above with a broken heart.<\/p><p><strong>Character 3 - wary, sarcastic, smart<\/strong><\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/RollandJax.png\" alt=\"RollandJax\" width=\"309\" height=\"494\" \/><p>ROLLAND JAX (age 31): Rolland is con artist who uses his good looks and charm to grift clueless youth with money. His favorite prowling grounds are colleges where he can take easy advantage of students and their rich parents. Unfortunately Rolland is not getting any younger and his ability to blend into campus life and charm his way out of trouble is starting to fail him. Rolland is fond of vintage dinner jackets.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~character-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":".\/exercise\/DevProFreebirdCharacter.stack","instructions":"<h1>Goals<\/h1><ol><li>Learn how to customize sprite costumes in Game Stack.<\/li><li>Build a version of the Freebird game that contains your own character art.<\/li><\/ol><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Click the <img src=\".\/images\/downloadbutton.png\" alt=\"layout.png\"\/> button at the top or bottom of this page to download the DevProFreebirdCharacter.stack file.<\/li><li>Save the file to a location you can access on your computer.<\/li><li>Click to open the file in Game Stack.<\/li><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/gamecharacter-gameloaded.png\" alt=\"layout.png\"\/><li>Modify CellMate sprite's costumes:<p>The cell mate is a character that is in the birdcage with you.

Technological limitations in the early years of video games used to be a huge factor in restricting story. Even then, however, characters and story were implied. Think of the story being told in games like <em>Pac-Man<\/em> and <em>Donkey Kong.<\/em> They are simple, to be sure, but there are unique characters and stories being told in both games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_whatsyourstory.png\" alt=\"image_whatsyourstory\" width=\"713\" height=\"373\" \/><p>As technology has advanced (in particular Artificial Intelligence or A.I.), so has the medium's ability to tell bigger, more complex stories. In fact, we are now at the point where stories in video games can be more layered and complex than even films and books. This is because the video game medium of storytelling is interactive in a way a book or movie can never be. Stories in video games can also be told in a non-linear format, which opens up new ways to develop and reveal plot and conflict.<\/p><p>Today storytelling in video games continues to expand with technology and becomes ever more competitive with traditional storytelling mediums. Video game critics now review story as much as mechanics which sets ever higher expectations for story and character in future games. The standards for story in video games are now set at a very high bar; however the techniques for creating a good story largely remain the same, with a few new considerations and options.<\/p><p>This Module is a companion to the Character's Module. Together they help highlight some fundamental considerations in developing character and story in video games. This Module will often refer to Character Development and it is recommended that the Character Development Module be studied first.

For one, the story must be interactive or else the game is little more than a movie on a computer monitor. To accomplish the feat of storytelling, the video game author has many storytelling techniques in their toolkit to use to deliver the plot points throughout the game. Let's examine some of techniques and tools.<\/p><h3>Text and Narration<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_textandnarration.png\" alt=\"image_textandnarration\" width=\"908\" height=\"453\" \/><p>Use of text and narration are the most obvious and time tested storytelling techniques. They are the building blocks of most traditional storytelling mediums such as books and movies. Video games tell their stories in this method, as well, only with some major differences. In a book or a movie, the audience expects the story to just come out and be told in one medium of delivery: either by reading it or by watching it. Video games add other options but do not ignore the use of text and narration.<\/p><p>Many games will simply tell their backstory through text, just like a book. It used to be common for a game's instruction manual to tell a backstory in plain text (often due to the lack of opportunity to tell it anywhere else). Other games have taken the <em>Star Wars<\/em> method of scrolling text at the beginning of the game to get the backstory into the players' minds. Anyway it is done; text still relies on someone reading it. In games it is best to be brief when using text. Remember, the player has chosen to play a game, not read a book, so long periods of reading text in a user interface is not going to cut it.<\/p><p>Narration is a way of delivering story through spoken word. Instead of reading text, the story is orally presented (like a voice over in a movie). This cuts down on the player having to read small text on a computer monitor and allows for some tone of voice from the narrator to accentuate the mood and theme of the story. Once again, however, the audience has chosen to play a game, not see a movie. Narration is fine to start things off, but a constant voice explaining plot is going to get annoying.<\/p><p>Text and narration are best used sparingly or integrated into other techniques. They still require basic writing rules and methods in their structure and delivery, but they work just as well in video games as books and film, when used correctly.<\/p><h3>Cutscenes<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_cutscene.png\" alt=\"image_cutscene\" width=\"835\" height=\"407\" \/><p>Cutscenes are fully animated mini-movies that appear to the player, typically, at key points of the game's story or at major points of the player character's development. Cutscenes allow the player to play and focus on the game and still pause once in a while to be filled in on story points. When done correctly, cutscenes are a terrific way of telling story in a game. There are issues with cutscenes, however, that should be considered. First and foremost, they can be time consuming and costly to create. This is the difference between text and visuals and audio: a book is cheaper to produce than a television show. Adding cutscenes is going to be an added expense in time and money to make.<\/p><p>Cutscenes can also be overused. When a player is focused on their character development by raising their skills and power levels through playing the game, being forced to stop and watch a cutscene can become frustrating. Cutscenes work best if they are well placed at major story arcs and used only when they best advance the story and not distract the player. This requires the writer to be very shrewd in making cutscenes that excite and advance the story; yet still not feel like a pause in the game to clumsily toss out plot points. The rules for writing great cutscenes are the same as writing a great scene in a movie: it starts with tight structure, razor-sharp dialog, and burying the exposition.<\/p><h3>Characters and Dialog<\/h3><p>Telling a story through characters and dialog is a great method to use in video games. Not only does it immerse the audience without breaking the so-called fourth wall (the barrier between the game and player's worlds), it offers many opportunities for the player to interact with the game (an absolute necessity for the game medium the story is told in). The real trick is in finding the right places in a game to put the dialog. Luckily, there are a number of options.<\/p><p><strong>Dialog trees<\/strong> are often utilized in role-playing games or games with role-playing features. They present to the player an in-game conversation between a player character and a non-player character (NPC) from which the player can choose responses. This allows the authors an opportunity to subtly give plot information, develop characters, and create player immersion by making the world seem alive and real. At their worse, however, dialog trees can be tedious exercises of game stretching and poorly executed dialog. They can also be tricky things to deal with in that they offer choices to the player, which should, in theory, change the story for the player when chosen. This creates the need to implement the game in such a way that multiple storylines are possible and equally desirable.<\/p><p><strong>Dialog “one-offs” <\/strong>is another, simpler, way to improve character and story elements within a game. This is where the player hears either triggered or un-triggered burst of dialog from a character on screen (sometimes even off screen). For example, the character the player is controlling might just start talking to themselves or others at random or keyed locations. There is no choice to be made for the player, the dialog just happens. What this allows is a tiny bit of character development and story exposition to be given in a non-intrusive manner that does not stop the game or require the player to make choices that can change the story. The game <em>Left4Dead<\/em> utilized this method to near perfection. Each player character had dozens of random and keyed lines of dialog that the characters would speak outside of the player's control or actions. This created personalities for the characters that would otherwise be nearly non-existent. This, in turn, gave the game humor, character distinction (even though they all had the same abilities) and a good dose of filling out a story that adds to the overall game experience.<\/p><h3>Visuals as Narrative Context<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_VisualNarrativeContext.png\" alt=\"image_VisualNarrativeContext\" width=\"786\" height=\"524\" \/><p>Because video games are now such a visual medium of storytelling, we can use that to our advantage in laying out a story to the audience. This is because the old cliché is true: a picture tells a thousand words. Let's examine how that is so and how we can utilize visuals in storytelling.<\/p><p>Consider a location in a game. What story does it tell without saying a word? First, think of who lives there. A brightly colored town with doe-eyed, winged pixies as its inhabitants tells an immediate story to the player and implies certain expectations. In this example, the story the visuals imply might cause a player to suspect this is a world of magic and fantasy creatures. Now, what if the color in the center of town was dull gray and muted? What if some of the pixies looked sad and dirty while other were bright and happy? The player now starts to smell a mystery in the works. What has caused this split in the town? Why are some pixies sad and others happy? Because a story is being established, the player might now start thinking into the future. What might happen if I start investigating the town? Will the bright pixies start to become mean if I help the sad pixies?<\/p><p>This is all set up without a word of dialog. From here, a game designer might start to use dialog trees or dialog one-offs to further tell the tale of this town's troubles and immerse the player in exploring it. It is important to remember, no matter what methods or techniques a game designer chooses, consistent tone and mood are crucial to creating dramatic themes. There should be a limit in how many tonal changes a game is willing to go through. If pixies are illustrated as cute, lovable, fantasy creatures, then perhaps caution is called for if the next step is to give them laser beam eyes that turn people into robots.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"developing-story-in-video-games-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Categories of Game Narratives<\/h1><p>Video games are unique as a storytelling medium in that they do not have to tell just one story. That is to say, a book or a movie never changes from one viewing to the next. We as the audience may change and find new insight or criticism in the story, but the story itself plays out exactly the same every time. This is not necessarily true or even desirable in a video game. Because of the depth and variety a game can offer over another medium, games have many other narrative options. These include games that have more than one narrative, games that change the story based on player actions or decisions and games that allow players to make up their own stories.<\/p><h3>Linear Paths<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_linearworld.png\" alt=\"image_linearworld\" width=\"545\" height=\"478\" \/><p>A linear narrative means that the story will be told from start to finish, and it will never vary in its delivery of plot points. Typically games with linear narratives will also have linear game design. For these types of games the story is meant to accentuate the gameplay not be a part of it. The story helps fill in the details to push some level of immersion but the goals of the player are not affected by knowing the story. Whether they follow the story or not, they will still play the game in the same way. They may enjoy the game less (or more if the story is bad) but it doesn't matter in terms of completing the game. This does not mean the story must be trivial or small. Linear narratives can create amazing stories within games, they just don't affect gameplay. <em>Halo<\/em>, for example, has a fairly detailed and engaging story, but it is entirely optional for the player to follow along. Not following the story does not stop the player from moving through the game just fine.<\/p><h3>Branching Narratives<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_branchingnarrative.png\" alt=\"image_branchingnarrative\" width=\"797\" height=\"530\" \/><p>Games that utilize branching narratives offer a little more to players in terms of story variation. Branching narratives means that players are offered some choices that will change some aspects of the story. This is done through creating multiple separate paths for the character to take that moves them from one story to another. It is a digital fork in the road where one direction is a completely different story than the other. Sometimes when a “road” is chosen, it is irreversible. The other path becomes blocked off permanently unless the player starts over and chooses the other path when they reach that point in the game again. This cut-off is often done for story reasons. To allow both paths would create story contradictions. For example, the player may be offered the chance to save a town from a wizard or join the wizard in turning everyone into frogs. Once the player chooses one, the other one is no longer an option. There is still some obvious game engineering going on in the player's head as they witness these branching narratives. They can imagine where each choice leads and make some conscious decision on how to play the game. However, this implies that they care. If the choices and decisions seem forced, clichéd, or uninteresting, then they have failed as a feature of the game. They must also be balanced. If one path leads to an immediate game over situation and the other leads to hours of fun and engagement, then there is a serious problem with the branching narratives in that game. Once again, storytelling in games needs to be more than great plot and structure; it needs to work within the game itself. Finally, branching narratives are going to take much more time and planning in the game design stage of pre-production than a linear narrative, because there is so much complexity in design and material to be utilized.<\/p><h3>Implied Narratives<\/h3><p>Some games do not have a structured narrative, but instead offer an implied narrative. This means that the game simply presents a world to explore without any story elements beyond interacting with the world. What makes this kind of game work, typically, is that it is built to be a massive multiplayer online game (MMO). When lots of people share a world with an implied narrative, the players themselves create the stories in the game.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_sims.png\" alt=\"image_sims\" width=\"335\" height=\"473\" \/><p>Consider simulation games like <em>SIMS<\/em>. These worlds offer players things to do, but no real storylines to follow. However, there are few to no restrictions in how a player chooses to explore the world. And their experience in the world will be completely unique for them. This is because they will interact with perhaps hundreds of other players that fill in their own “character dialog” with unpredictable statements in real-time. Of course, no amount of dialog planning can achieve this level of diversity and variation. So, on a plus side, players form their own motivations for playing in the world, mostly based off their ability to play completely free-form. This free-form style of play then generates its own storylines depending on what players decide they want to do. On the negative side, this type of game requires lots of diverse players to generate story content. From a game design point of view, to achieve this type of narrative, the game must present a lot of activities for player to do, and these activities must in some way define who they are in the game. From there, player interaction and imagination take over.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"developing-story-in-video-games-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Story Intent vs. Player Actions<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_characterarc2.png\" alt=\"image_characterarc2\" width=\"793\" height=\"466\" \/><p>So now that we have chosen our style of narrative, what could go wrong? Here we return to our discussions on flow and pacing. The problem we now face is a conflict of the game designer's intended story and the misperception of that story due to player actions. It happens like this:<\/p><p>Imagine a game that has all the whistles and bells of a great looking open world setting. The game designer threw in cutscenes, dialog trees, and even ambient sounds and experiences. And, of course, there is a rich story that unfolds in a sequence that maximizes pacing and flow. The intention of the game is for the player to become a hero from humble roots and to face the Dark Power that sweeps over the land. We can think of this story as the Intended Story of the game. There is, however, another story that the designers can't avoid, the Gameplay Story.<\/p><h3>Intended Story vs. Gameplay Story<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_cutscene.png\" alt=\"image_cutscene\" width=\"835\" height=\"407\" \/><p>The idea is that all games tell two stories. The Intended Story is the sum of cutscenes, dialog, dialog trees, visual clues and all of the story elements the authors put into the game to tell the story they created for the game. The Gameplay Story is the story that actually plays out for the player as they play the game. It is the story that surfaces through how the player chooses to play the game.<\/p><p>For example, the designers may have a quest that brings the player to a village in need of the player's help. In this village are NPCs who will talk to the PC and direct him or her to the problem the designers have programmed for the PC to fix. Perhaps there is even a cutscene to introduce the village and give the player a sense of what heroic deed needs to be done. If the player approaches this area of the world as intended, they will enter the village aware that a problem exists. Their time in this village is paced out nicely by having the PC talk to villagers and find clues to the “monster”. We achieve flow as each sequence of actions the player does takes them closer to their goal, trains them in meaningful skills, and motivates them to continue forward.<\/p><p>Now, imagine if the player doesn't approach the village as intended. First, they skip the cutscene. Perhaps they are tired of breaks in the action. Perhaps the game has too many cutscenes that are dull. For whatever they choose to ignore it, they have now started to alter the in-game experience the authors intended. Next, let's pretend the player decides not to talk to anyone but instead wants to cast his ‘fear spell' on random villagers. As the player walks around the village scaring people with his or her magic ability, they discover the dark cave the NPCs would have directed them to. They enter it and defeat the monster.<\/p><p>As we can see, this scenario plays out much differently than the author's intentions. The player skipped many of the elements that were designed to create a coherent story. They have messed up pacing by not following the procedures the designers wanted them to. They have also caused a ripple effect throughout the rest of the game by not playing the game as they were supposed to. Perhaps talking to a certain villager was required to gain an item after the monster is defeated and now that item is unobtainable.<\/p><p>The point is, because of a game's interactive nature, the story the author designs in the game, may not be the story the player actually sees if they make choices the game designers could not, or did not predict. The game assumes a certain course of action from the player and even went out of its way with dialog and visuals to push the player in that direction. However, by choosing to allow player options and a non-linear story path, there is great potential for the Gameplay story to overwhelm the Intended Story. This may be great fun for the player for a while, but ultimately it shortens or eliminates content, pacing, and flow as the player quickly becomes bored in the world.<\/p><p>As a game designer, it is important to keep these kinds of unintended consequences in mind. Each game must find its own balance in terms of linear vs. non-linear paths, plot devices, and a player's freedom to create their own, personalized stories and experiences.<\/p><h3>Embedded Narratives<\/h3><p>A game designer can avoid most of the issues of a player's play-style conflicting with the Intended Story by eliminating options that alter the story. When this is done it is called an Embedded Story. There is nothing the player can do to alter the story, no actions they can take to not make the game progress as designed except failure in moving down a set linear path. In this case, the player might have only one unavoidable path leading to that village which triggers a cutscene the player must watch. In addition, the NPCs could approach the PC and automatically tell them the information the designers want them to have. Finally, with information in hand, the only path from there leads directly to the cave and the encounter that fuels the story from here.<\/p><p>This method solves the issue of the Gameplay Story overwhelming the Intended Story; however, it has its own problems. First and foremost, if a designer is going to force a player to absorb every single plot point and then demand they play the game in a perfect linear path, then the gameplay and story had better be spectacular. In other words, if the player only has one option to find “flow” then that option has to deliver. Another issue is game designed like this can start to feel more like a movie than a game. There is a risk that mechanics aren't deep or meaningful, but instead are just pointless exercises to keep the story going.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"developing-story-in-video-games-5\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Sample Cutscene<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_characters2.png\" alt=\"image_characters\" width=\"957\" height=\"519\" \/><p>We have looked at creating characters, discussed narratives, and examined how these elements can blend in unexpected ways to create and control pacing and flow. Now we will focus a bit on creating good stories. As mentioned, the cutscene is an effective way to advance story in a game; but only if it has intriguing characters and a tight, compelling plot. Looking back at the Characters Module, we see we want to deliver information to the player in a way that feels natural. The goal is to “bury the exposition” in sharp dialog that entertains as it informs. Below is a sample script that could be a cutscene introducing a game or a new level.  The goals we will set for ourselves in this example are as follows:<\/p><p>We will write a short cutscene, in script format, using the three characters we created in the Character's Module. Through dialog and setting we need to impart the following information to the player:<\/p><ol><li>The setting is in the woods, near an old water pump station.<\/li><li>Our three characters are preparing for a dangerous mission, where they must rescue a group of people trapped by monsters.<\/li><li>Each character has a unique personality and voice and each has a motivation.<\/li><li>One of the characters has a family member among those to be rescued.<\/li><li>The group is desperate and the odds are against them.<\/li><li>To lead to the designed gameplay after the cutscene, we need to set up that one of the characters will need to pick a lock while the others defend against the monsters.<\/li><li>The monsters are scary and dangerous to even be close to.<\/li><\/ol><p>Okay, let's see what we can do to impart all of this while burying the exposition in great dialog and character interaction. Note that this is written in a non-standard film script format.<\/p><p>FADE IN<\/p><p>Close on a man's rugged face<\/p><p>He holds a pained expression and rubs his forehead with his thumb and finger as a sudden and extreme headache hits him.<\/p><p>PULL BACK TO REVEAL FRANK ON A...<\/p><p>EXT.

Rolland stands next to Frank as Keira slightly ahead of them, continues walking.<\/p><p><strong>FRANK; <\/strong>Keira, stop. We're close.<\/p><p>She stops. Rolland rubs his head in pain.<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND: <\/strong>Of course we're close. My brain has turned into a runaway train crashing into my forehead.<\/p><p>Frank scowls at Rolland as Keira crouches and pulls a map from her backpack. Frank waits quietly beside her, studying her as she studies the map. Rolland gets anxious and begins rambling.  Frank and Keira ignore him.<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND <\/strong>(CONT'D): Did you know bears really stink? I mean, I've heard bears really stink. They say you can't really just accidentally trip over a bear in the woods because their smell is so horrible. And surprisingly, polar bears are supposed to be the worst.<\/p><p>Frank and Keira continue to ignore him.<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND<\/strong> (CONT'D); Anyway, it was surprising to me. I was just mentioning it because I thought it was appropriate; because if it were a bear we were after, we'd probably be smelling it right now...<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA: <\/strong>The pump station should be just up ahead.<\/p><p>Keira marches forward, her face stern against the pain.<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND: <\/strong>...Instead of bleeding our brains out of our ears.<\/p><p>Frank gives Rolland a hard stare.  Rolland goes for broke.<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND<\/strong> (CONT'D): Did you ever have to fight a bear in the marines, Frank?<\/p><p><strong>FRANK: <\/strong>Don't you ever shut up?<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND: <\/strong>I was just trying to ease the tension a bit.<\/p><p><strong>FRANK: <\/strong>I like my tension how it is.<\/p><p>Rolland and Frank come around the bend in the road to see Keira perched on a rock. She wears an odd looking set of eye goggles made of thick copper.  It is covered in various dials and levers.<\/p><p><strong>FRANK<\/strong> (CONT'D): Get down from there, they'll see you!<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA: <\/strong>They're blind.<\/p><p><strong>FRANK: <\/strong>You know what I mean, they'll sense you or whatever.<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA: <\/strong>Then the rock won't matter.<\/p><p>Keira starts working the dials on the goggles, her face straining with pain as she does.<\/p><p>ANGLE THROUGH KEIRA'S GOGGLES<\/p><p>As lenses flip, Keira's vision penetrates through the thick canopy of dead trees as they become suddenly ghostly and then disappear. As the trees clear, she sees an old pump station.  It is a rusted metal shack with a metal door and a concrete foundation. Yellow and red ichor covers the door.  What appears to be a massive claw mark runs down the top, ending at a bent door handle. A human arm lies on the ground nearby.<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA <\/strong>(CONT'D): I can see the pump house.  The lock on the door looks like it's been damaged.<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND: <\/strong>That could be a problem.<\/p><p>BACK TO SCENE<\/p><p><strong>FRANK: <\/strong>Good to know.  Now come down and take those things off.<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA: <\/strong>Not yet - I'm going to look inside the pump house.<\/p><p>ANGLE THROUGH KEIRA'S GOGGLES<\/p><p>As dials turn and lenses flip, the pump house starts to fade into a translucent haze, becoming incorporeal.  Our vision now penetrates the walls to reveal three human figures huddled together in the darkness.  A fourth figure leans motionless against a far wall, his left arm missing.  A broken pumping machine fills the rest of the space with two large pipes running from the ground to the back wall.<\/p><p>BACK TO SCENE<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA: <\/strong>I see them!  My sister is there!<\/p><p>Keira's eyes start to tear and her faces grows red with strain.<\/p><p><strong>FRANK: <\/strong>Now get down!<\/p><p><strong>ROLLAND: <\/strong>Wait a second, since you got the peepers on, how about taking a peek around for those things.<\/p><p>Frank looks like he wants to strangle Rolland for saying it but knows it must be done.<\/p><p>ANGLE THROUGH KEIRA'S GOGGLES<\/p><p>Keira pans around the outside of the pump house, again flipping dials and lenses.  As the material world returns to view, three large CREATURES focus into frame near the pump station.  Their skin is grey and gaunt but hard and smooth, with barbed plates jutting from their spines.  Their chests are oversized for the rest of their bodies and their rib-cages show through in vile detail.  Their arms are long and thin but end in three razor sharp claws that drip a vile yellow substance.  On their shoulders sit skeletal-like heads that resemble some sort of dark sea angler fish nightmare, complete with a protruding pineal gland in the forehead.<\/p><p>A dial on the goggles turns and we CLOSE IN on one of them; seeing greater detail of the awful thing.  Its vile appendage slowly turns directly at camera.<\/p><p>BACK TO SCENE<\/p><p>Keira muffles her scream as she jumps behind the rock.  We see her heavy breathing as sweat beads on her forehead and blood flows from her left nostril.  Frank quickly removes the goggles.<\/p><p><strong>FRANK: <\/strong>You should have stopped!<\/p><p>Frank removes a rag from his pocket and starts to wipe Keira's face.  She pushes him off and stands.<\/p><p><strong>KEIRA: <\/strong>I'm okay.

Now that we have discussed the broad theories of game design, let's see how some of those theories are applied to level design. This Module will also discuss useful level design goals and examine how theory and practical design come together. In particular, this Module will cover the following Topics:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#level-design-and-environments-2\">Achieving Level Design Goals<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#level-design-and-environments-3\">Environment Building Tools<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#level-design-and-environments-4\">Open World vs. Linear Environments<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"level-design-and-environments-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Achieving Level Design Goals<\/h1><p>What is good level design? Players know it when they see it, but is it all just guesswork? We have previously discussed many design concepts and goals on a very broad basis. Now we will begin to apply those basics to actual level design. Let's begin by reviewing some of our level design goals.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_Flow1.png\" alt=\"image_Flow1\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" \/><h3>Achieving Flow, Pacing, and Balance in Level Design<\/h3><p>First and foremost, a game should be fun to play. In terms of level design, we want the game to be fun to navigate. Game worlds should be intriguing, guide players through the level, and ultimately achieve flow. Remember, flow is that nebulous state of being happy and engaged with a game.  We achieve flow through pacing and balance in level design. In turn, we achieve pacing and balance in level design by constructing the environment to guide the player through the level in the way the designer wants them to. We could call this, flow control.<\/p><h3>Constraints as Flow Control<\/h3><p>For a game to have flow, players need a goal or destination, an intriguing and somewhat obvious path to get there, and some indication of what to do when they arrive. A proper and well-planned game environment is the best way for designers to achieve these goals.<\/p><p>The most obvious tool in our flow control bag of tricks is the physical limitations we can apply to the environment. For example, let's say we want a player to take his or her character from Point A to Point B. We are immediately faced with some questions. How do they know they are supposed to go to Point B in the first place? Also, what if they go in the wrong direction, say to some player imagined Point C? The easy answer is: don't let them. That is to say, we create obvious or highly suggested paths to initiate the player's movement in the right direction.<\/p><p>Here we see an environment with some physical constraints on where a player can go. In this example, we have built a mountainside for players to explore, however, we want to limit their initial choices for where they can go. So as part of the level design and as a way to create immersion in our world, we will design these constraints to match logically with our world. In this case, we have a rockslide that restricts the player from exploring certain parts of the map.<\/p><h3>Linear Paths<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_Flow2.gif\" alt=\"image_Flow2\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" \/><p>The most common physical limitation in environment design is a linear path. A linear path only gives one option for the player's direction. Returning to our dilemma of encouraging our player to go from Point A to Point B, we can use linear paths to direct the player by removing all other direction options. The player will quickly realize he or she only has one option which fulfills our need for instantly informing the player of what to do (go to Point A, it is the only choice).  Of course, the problem with this solution is it just removes player options. It does not, in itself, create flow, in the sense it could be very boring just navigating one direction. It also does not yet require any skills to be learned or provide any motivation to play the game. We also cannot control pacing unless we plan for a very short game. What we need are obstacles.<\/p><h3>Obstacles<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_obstacles.png\" alt=\"image_obstacles\" width=\"523\" height=\"345\" \/><p>Obstacles are just what they sound like: they are challenges the player must overcome to progress in the game. Obstacles allow game designers to open up the linear path restrictions some to provide opportunities for fun and to use and learn in-game skills. They also allow us to begin to control the pace of the game. For example, we could now create multiple paths but still heavily entice the player to go the direction we want them to initially. The player at Point A could see an option to go to Point C, but be discouraged to do so with difficult obstacles. An obstacle can be anything we want it to be, as long as it fits the context of the environment. Let's say our Point A is at a starting point on the mountainside. We want the player to go first to Point B, but we want to hide this intention from the player to give them a bigger sense of the world and their perceived options working within that world. So we make going from Point A to Point B the easiest and most rewarding at this stage of the game. The obstacles in going from A to B will be designed according to our theories on creating skill loops. Let's pretend that the player will have to jump to avoid falling rocks to get to Point B. Now we can start to control pacing with how many rocks we want to throw at the player in a given space. We can carefully control skill improvement and we can also insert some needed fun into the game. Finally, we will reward the player for making the choice to go to Point B.<\/p><p>At the same time we encourage certain player behavior (go this way), we can also discourage the player from choosing any other behavior.  We can do this by making obstacles that strongly hint to the player to try a different behavior. For example, we could create a rock slide that is extremely difficult to navigate without advanced skill mastery of our jumping mechanic. We can increase the likelihood of the player going the route the designer intended by increasing the difficulty level of going any other route. The trick is making sure the players can actually pick up on the environmental clues enough to understand that they need to acquire the basic jump skills first, before taking on the rockslide.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"level-design-and-environments-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Environment Building Tools<\/h1><p>We can also control balance, pacing, and create fun through environmental building tools and tricks. One often overlooked design tool is giving the player environmental clues. Visual design of a level is going to be very valuable in seeding our environmental clues. What the player sees in the world will inform them of possible decision consequences for their actions. They will look at the world, the environment and tell themselves, “It is okay to act in this manner”. This is important because we want the player to feel in charge of their actions. We want them to see what to do without being told what to do. So how does this work, exactly?<\/p><h3>Environmental Clues<\/h3><p>With good visual planning, we can seed concepts to the player without saying a word. Continuing with our mountain climbing game example, we might have a level design where the player must climb a simple rock wall. First, they might see their character dressed in climbing gear, perhaps with ropes and hooks. They might start at the base of the mountain with some initial hanging ropes to get started. This tells the player that physical actions will probably be required. Next, the player might see unstable rocks around their avatar. This tells them that they should look out for rocks and that dodging these rocks might very well be a challenge they will have to face. This, in turn, makes the player start playing with their control of their character to see what they can do. Behold! The character can jump to the side when a button is pushed. In doing so, we have seeded a goal: get good at jumping away from falling rocks.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_environmentalclues.png\" alt=\"image_environmentalclues\" width=\"715\" height=\"366\" \/><p>Now we have achieved something: the player is rewarded for figuring out how the environment will be challenging as well as beginning to understand how to overcome those challenges. The fact that they discovered this on their own is rewarding and fun.<\/p><p>The game's visual clues need to maintain logic and consistency to be effective. If your game is set in a dark fantasy world of vampires and vampire hunters, seeing bones in the environment might indicate to the player this is a deadly world and they will be required to defend themselves, leading them to find ways to do so. Starting a character on a small island surrounded by water is also going to seed its own set of player assumptions that can be capitalized upon for level and environment design.<\/p><h3>Other Environment Design Tricks<\/h3><p>Seeding suggestive environmental clues through aesthetics is by far the most subtle way to create player flow. Video games have used many other techniques that are more overt. The purpose is always the same, though, to achieve player flow.  Their success at doing so, tends to vary greatly from game to game.<\/p><p><strong>Breadcrumbs<\/strong><\/p><p>A term taken from the popular fairy tale, <em>Hansel and Gretel<\/em>, breadcrumbs in video games are simply marked paths for players to navigate. They don't have to be literal breadcrumbs; they can be footprints, string, magical aura trails, or just about anything that is generally fixed and unalterable by the player. Sometimes breadcrumbs are optional. A game might offer a button or in-game spell to turn breadcrumbs on or off. In any regard, breadcrumbs are used to keep players from getting lost or taking wrong paths.<\/p><p><strong>Power-Ups and Collectables<\/strong><\/p><p>Like breadcrumbs, power-ups and collectables are tools to lead players through the game in a controlled manner that, optimally, will create fun and flow. Collectables are things players must find in the game to give them clues for going forward. At its most basic level, a collectable gives the player a short term goal that, once achieved, open a new short term goal. These goals then stack to create a bigger, more epic, quest. For example, say we are making a mystery game. We want to encourage players to explore the world and find clues, but it is a little too big of a world to just let them find their own way. We might use collectables this way: The player must find a series of clues in the form of lost books in the world. Each book is contained in a smaller part of the overall world, cutting down on the player being lost or frustrated. As one book is found, it gives clues (or perhaps just opens new areas to explore) on the location of the next book.<\/p><p>Power-ups work in a similar fashion, but instead of giving the player information or unlocking clues, they make the player's character in the game more powerful. In doing so, the player can now take on bigger challenges. In our canyon example from earlier, we could use this concept very neatly. Once the player reaches Point B, they could receive a power-up that makes them jump faster or higher. Now they have the ability to take on the much harder path to Point C. The player feels they are steadily improving (in character power or player skill) and doing so at a pace that keeps the game fun. It is has potential for being meaningful and keeps the gameplay themes.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"level-design-and-environments-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Open World vs. Linear Environments<\/h1><p>There is nothing right or wrong with games that choose an open world format over a linear environment, they are simply design choices, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. In this Topic we are going to take a closer look at the pros and cons of open world and linear environments in games.<\/p><h3>Open World Environments<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_openworld.png\" alt=\"image_openworld\" width=\"529\" height=\"477\" \/><p>Open world environments offer players a sense of control and realism. Without a forced linear path, the game creates a desire to slow down and explore. That can lead to problems however. First, the world will need lots of content choices for the player. If they decide to bypass a part of the game to explore something else, then that something else needs to be accessible and balanced to the player going there in terms of player skill mastery requirements or character power.<\/p><p>Another issue with open world games is in integrating story elements. Non-linear storytelling is more difficult to make work in open world games. If the authors do not know where a player will go and in what order quests will be taken, it becomes tricky to seed plot points that require linear events to activate. That problem can be handled with meticulous planning and allowing for some flexibility in the story. Here is the real trick with story in open world games: the story the authors want to tell about the characters is not always reflected in the actions of the player. For example, imagine an open world game that wants to tell the story of a man seeking redemption from his past in a modern urban landscape. We can conceive how the main quest and mini-quests can support this thematic goal fairly easily. However, in allowing the player to ignore these quests and simply explore and play in the world on their own, they may not pick up on the redemption themes. In fact, they may go the opposite route and just see what causing havoc all over the city is like. Now the author's story themes and plot are in contradiction to the “hero's” actions.<\/p><h3>Open World Endings<\/h3><p>There is also the issue of an ending to the game in an open world design. Executing an exciting climax to an open ended world design can wind up feeling unfulfilling if the player has not followed the plot and feels the ending is abrupt. If an ending cuts off their ability to continue playing in the world, players will be unhappy they cannot continue on. If completing the main quest ends the game, even if the player has unfinished side quests, players will be unhappy.<\/p><p>These issues bring into consideration the idea of not having a closed ending that is based on plot completion. This allows us to not have to close off playing the game just because we have run out of author generated plot. It also allows the player to determine their own sense of when the game is over and play the game with their own private narrative. On the negative side, without a closed ending, the player's interest may drift to the point that they just stop playing the game because they become bored. Without an exciting conclusion to cap the experience, players have little reason to play any sequels or expansions to the title.<\/p><h3>Linear Environments<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_linearworld.png\" alt=\"image_linearworld\" width=\"545\" height=\"478\" \/><p>Linear designed games have the same issues as open world games, only in reverse. On the positive side, linear design allows the authors to control the narrative and create a more dramatic and directed experience. With a linear design it is easier to lay out clear goals for the player. In addition, players are less likely to miss plot points and player skill mastery can be planned on at set stages of the game. In fact, overall, designers can focus the player on a more limited scope and as such make that limited view much richer and detailed than they can for an open world model.<\/p><p>In turn, this decreases the feeling a player has that they are in control and that their choices matter. The biggest complaint about linear games is that they don't really offer any choice. In fact, in many linear games, choice is an illusion. Although good design will hide this fact, linear games are much more of a hand-holding experience. Players are told directly to <em>go here<\/em> and <em>do this<\/em>. For many, this feels like a pointless exercise, in particular if the story is weak.<\/p><p>Many games now work to create some blend of open world and linear design. They find new and clever ways to integrate story and mechanics that offer player-choice, tight storytelling, and character development. In coming Modules we will take a closer look at storytelling and use of characters in video games.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~level-design-and-environments-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference

We will also examine some ways to integrate player objectives, and how to motivate play through some time tested tricks of the industry. Finally, we will look at how In-Game economies work and add their own structures to a game.<\/p><p>In detail, this Module will cover:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-structure-2\">Creating Rules for a Video Game<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-structure-3\">Objectives, Conflicts, and Outcomes<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-structure-4\">In-Game Economies<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-structure-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Creating Rules of a Game<\/h1><p>There is no real standard for how a video game should be structured. Programming will demand its own structure standards, but there are many non-programming based structure concepts that will always be valid to consider. We call this the Good Game Checklist. It is a broad scope view of the most fundamental elements that need to be considered in creating a fun, well-conceived game or mechanic.<\/p><h3>Tight Concept<\/h3><p>A tight concept is a crucial step in the process of structuring a solid video game. The brilliance of a concept will automatically inform the player of how the game is built and how it may operate. When creating a concept for a mechanic it should serve a purpose. Most often this purpose is going to be that it serves to entertain the player and inform them of the game mechanics, the world or some other part of the game the designer wants the player to experience. In addition to being entertaining, a tight concept, no matter how complex its design and function, must be easy to comprehend for the Player. Remember, though, that easy comprehension of how the concept works is not the same as making it easy to master. This plays more into the next item on our checklist.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_tetrisblocks.png\" alt=\"image_tetrisblocks\" width=\"729\" height=\"248\" \/><p><em>Pac-Man<\/em> is an example of a game with a tight concept. The gameplay is easy to understand; the mechanics are compelling and easy to learn but difficult to master; and the whole experience is enhanced by terrific sound and images. The concept is concise and well executed.<\/p><h3>Fun Mechanics<\/h3><p>Once a tight concept has been established, the next step is to make fun mechanics. So what makes a mechanic fun? It must be more than just the act of pushing letters on a keyboard or typing essays on a computer would be great entertainment. What makes any mechanic “fun” is strictly a matter of subjective option vs. good structure. There are, however, a few general concepts to keep in mind. First, a fun mechanic is easy to identify. The Player instantly understands what the task or mechanic is and why it must be performed. Secondly, once identified, the mechanic must be easy to learn and improve upon. Players have fun when they perceive themselves mastering, even slowly, a mechanic. This is really a balance of labor vs. reward, which will be discussed more below. Finally, a fun mechanic is meaningful or “deep”. Meaningful, in game terms, means that while the mechanic is fun to explore for the Player, it actually has a larger purpose or meaning within the game. This purpose could be any number of things; psychological immersion adding enjoyment to the experience; educational value where the mechanic actually teaches a skill or some aspect of the game world; or just building a cohesive experience to define the gameplay. In other words, a meaningful mechanic is designed to express the themes and functions of the game while remaining easy to identify and easy to get started learning and improving.<\/p><p>Sports games often shine because their mechanics so closely resemble the actions on the field. There mechanics are meaningful in that they feel like real actions a player would take, and fun in that they allow a player to feel the thrill of playing professional sports.<\/p><h3>Reactive Controls<\/h3><p>Even a great concept for a new and innovative mechanic can be instantly derailed by poor execution of the player's control of that mechanic. Poor, or un-reactive, control creates frustration in the player and causes them to want to quit the game. All of the promises of fun and meaningful mechanics are lost to the fact that the controls to enact a mechanic are unable to create the desired purpose simply because of sloppy execution.<\/p><p>The goal here is to create reactive controls. Reactive control means the player can easily use the controller to accomplish goals and has immediate response from the controller when they want or need it. When this works as it should, the player actually forgets about using the controller consciously and begins to seamlessly blend mechanics and immersive gameplay. They become “lost” in the game's intended design instead of being aware of it.<\/p><p>For example, timing jumps are crucial to games like <em>Mario Bros<\/em>. and other platform jumpers. If Mario does not jump at the exact moment the player pushes the button he will miss the target. In this case, the controller reaction will make the game unplayable.<\/p><h3>Motivators and Rewards<\/h3><p>By integrating a tight concept, fun mechanics, and reactive controls, we now have the tools to create incentives for players to continue playing the game. Incentives are the motivators and rewards that give the player a reason to play. Fun is always the best motivator and reward, but fun can also be the hardest incentive to achieve.<\/p><p>In one game, the mechanic to jump the gap is motivated by the reward of reaching the other side and continuing the game. When the Player attempts to make the jump, the reactive controls gives them a high chance of success with practice and a sense of fun in ultimately achieving the goal of making the jump. Here we not only have a series of motivators and rewards, but each combines and adds to the other creating larger loops of motivators and rewards. For example, along with jump, the player may have been mastering other controller skills simultaneously. The skills sync perfectly with all of the other game elements such as sound and visuals. Each of these isolated mechanics then combines in the overall experience to create an accumulative motivator and reward cycle.<\/p><p>There are three basic considerations when designing motivators and rewards. The first is the idea of creating consistent player skill improvement. This is in addition to fun and smooth controls. The player needs to feel as if they are making progress mastering the controls and challenges throughout the course of the game. Failing this creates frustration and a willingness to drop the game. The player must also identify a clear learning curve to improvement. This allows the skill mastering to be challenging without the player wondering if they are, in fact, improving. This is followed with positive feedback, or an acknowledgement from the game that the player is doing well and improving. Positive feedback can come in many different forms, such as; awarding experience points; a power-up of some kind; completion of a level; a new in-game ability and more.<\/p><h3>Smooth Interface<\/h3><p>Much like the need for a reactive controller, a smooth interface design not only enhances gameplay, but it also helps eliminate player frustration. This is done by designing interactions with the interface to be easy to navigate and organized to be pleasing to the eye. Easy to navigate means the player doesn't spend time looking for ways to do the things they want to in the game. This includes not only the gameplay interface, but all the other interfaces such as options screens, save and load screens, etc. When a game interface has these components and quickly gets the player to having fun, it is said to have good flow.<\/p><h3>Original Style<\/h3><p>This might seem to go without saying but a game concept or mechanic should have originality. Believe it or not, not every possible video game mechanic has been invented yet. While it is true, the most obvious and basic mechanics are now well utilized (if not overused) there are always new ideas to develop. It is not, however, strictly required to create new mechanics. Even with an old mechanic, there is still room to explore and expand the ground already covered. In general, we can approach originality in a number of ways. The most obvious and easy to customize are the sound and visuals. New character and sound design can make the old seem new again, at least for a while. To counter the inevitable “I've done this before” effect, the mechanic can be innovated. In our jump example, we could add a double-jump allowing the character to reach bigger heights. Finally, we can add some creative flair. Perhaps the character does a flip in the air when jumping or perhaps they land in a gymnastics-like victory stance. The point is, there are many things to make a mechanic feel new and fun again without having to create entirely new concepts.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-structure-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Objectives, Conflicts, and Outcomes<\/h1><p>We can think of the structure of almost any game as breaking down into a set of objectives, conflicts, and outcomes.<\/p><h3>Objectives<\/h3><p>Objectives are in-game goals for the player to accomplish or master. These can be immediate objectives, such as jumping a gap; long-term objectives, such as defeating a level; or game objectives such as defeating the final boss. Layered objectives work nicely to constantly give the player short-term, long-term, and game wide interest and immersion throughout the entirety of the game.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_ObjectivesConflictsOutcomes.png\" alt=\"image_ObjectivesConflictsOutcomes\" width=\"719\" height=\"179\" \/><h3>Conflicts<\/h3><p>Conflict is what makes achieving objectives a challenge. Conflicts are designed to maximize the fun of achieving an objective without making it too easy or too hard for the player. The three most basic tools for creating conflict in a game are the use of opponents, obstacles, and dilemmas. Opponents represent conflicts with NPCs or other players. NPCs (or other characters for that matter) can be just about anything that reacts to a player's physical proximity. They typically force the player to deal with them in some particular manner such as combat or other competition. Obstacles are usually fixed location conflicts that are part of the game's environment. They often require the player to make decisions on what path to take or in finding ways around the obstacle. Often an obstacle is combined with a puzzle as the way of circumventing an obstacle. Finally, dilemmas create conflicts in the choices the player must make. For example, open world games present dilemmas of early world exploration vs. safe character growth. Even <em>Pac-Man<\/em> creates dilemmas: Is it worth trying to eat the cherry? Should ghost be attacked or when vulnerable or should Pac-Man just concentrate on eating the dots?<\/p><h3>Outcomes<\/h3><p>Outcomes are the consequences of a player's success or failure in conflicts. Games want to emphasis positive success outcomes and negative failure outcomes. This is tricky, however, because we don't want to over-reward or over-punish and we don't want to under-reward or under-punish. Balance, once again, is the key to making it fun and seamless. In many ways, outcomes are the most crucial to get right, because the positive outcomes of success are what will motivate the player to keep going. Too much work for too little reward and the player will become frustrated. Too much reward for too little work and the player will become bored.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-structure-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>In-Game Economies<\/h1><p>Video games are structures within structures within more structures. The bigger and more complex a game, the more structures it will have and support. As an example of an isolated structure that affects the overall structure of a game, let's look at in-game economies in video games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_GameEconomy.png\" alt=\"image_GameEconomy\" width=\"626\" height=\"470\" \/><h3>Virtual Currency<\/h3><p>There are many types of in-game economies with different purposes. Most common is the concept of virtual currency. Virtual currency systems, at their most basic, are structures within the game that allow the player(s) a way of customization; or the designer a way to control player improvement while teasing greater power to come. For example, a fantasy RPG may have the option to visit shops and purchase items. The gold to purchase these items comes from defeating monsters in the world (Objective=take gold from monsters; Conflict=monster's fight to keep it; Outcome=defeat monsters, get gold). Once the player has the gold, shops offer ways to spend that gold on better equipment that, in turn, allow the player to fight bigger monsters for bigger gold rewards. Clever design will also have items that offer great advantages (a flame sword perhaps) but is also out of the affordable range of the player upon seeing the option to buy it for the first time. Now the player is even more motivated to return to gameplay to fight more monsters and eventually earn the gold to buy the flaming sword.<\/p><p><em>Eve Online<\/em> is an excellent example of another type of in-game economy that uses virtual currency.  Eve's in-game economy is complex and vast and functions in many ways how real world economies behave. Players can collect materials in the game world, manufacture items with that material, and then bring those items to an in-game market that all players have access to. This system is so detailed that players can actually play exclusively as manufacturers and merchants, and do nothing else if they wish.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_Microtransactions.png\" alt=\"image_Microtransactions\" width=\"341\" height=\"273\" \/><h3>Micro-Transactions<\/h3><p>Micro-transaction economies are a little different. Typically, games with micro-transactions use them as a for profit pay model for the game. These games offer most or all of the game's content for free, but also offer the player(s) an opportunity to spend virtual currency (this time bought with real money) on upgrades and advantages in the game. For example, instead of exploring ten dungeons to accumulate the coins to purchase that flaming sword, the player simply paid five dollars in real cash (which he has because the game was free) to get the sword immediately. This kind of structure, however, can create many problems in design. By its very design, players with more money can instantly have an advantage over players with less money. If the game is multiplayer or an MMO, this can create balance issues that cause frustration and boredom at the same time; making the game for players with the flaming sword too easy and too hard for those without it.<\/p><p><em>Valve's<\/em> <em>Team Fortress 2<\/em> offers a compromise on micro-transaction purchases. Players are not able to purchase items that give a them an in-game advantage over other players. Instead, they can purchase special hats or rare weapons designs that customize a player character's look and style but not their effectiveness in the game. This has proven to be an incredibly successful pay model for Valve and very popular among Team Fortress 2 fans.<\/p><h3>Auction Houses<\/h3><p>Auction Houses are a sort compromise between strictly in-game economies and micro-economies. They allow an in-game market where supply and demand for purchasable items are determined by the players themselves. All items sold at the auction house come from achieving objectives in the game just like normal. However, players are then free to sell their spoils to other players at a price they determine themselves through open auction. This model actually creates new motivations for players. Perhaps a player has completed the game and now finds fun being a merchant of sorts to new players. This model also creates new, unexpected content, as players send other players on quests to bring items to the auction house.<\/p><p><em>Blizzard's World of Warcraft<\/em> has an in-game auction house with thousands of items. Each item was created or acquired within the game by a player and then brought to the auction house to sell to another player. In this case, no real-world currency is allowed, only virtual, in-game currency found while playing the game is accepted. This system also rewards those who play the game for long hours over those with extra real world cash to spend.<\/p><h3>Game Economies as Virtual Models<\/h3><p>Perhaps most fascinating is that in-game economies are actually virtual models of how real-world economies work. Bad in-game economies can destroy the intended markets just like good structures can make markets flourish. Each game with a virtual currency is a mini social experiment with economies that any market economists would be fascinated by. They, in fact, teach us how markets work and react with specific decisions and structures.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~game-structure-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":".\/exercise\/DevProProspectorPeril_ReactiveControls.stack","instructions":"        <h1>Goal<\/h1>        <p>            In this Exercise, we will evaluate a version of our vertical endless runner, <em>Prospector Peril<\/em>, using the Good Game Checklist.

The Prospector's upward speed decreases over time, but every time he hits an object his speed increases.  At the end of the game, you can see what your top speed was.  This is a great example of rewards and motivators.  A successful attack results in an immediate reward of speed points.  Getting a top speed score is a great motivator to play again.  Let's see what happens when we adjust these rewards and motivators in the game.<\/p>            <p>In the Prospector sprite, find Focus Area 3.  Notice that this block of code refers to a ProspectorSuccessfulAttack.  If the speed is less than 99, then a successful attack will change the speed by 1.  So if the Prospector's speed before the attack was 10, a successful attack will change his speed to 11.Let's experiment with this variable.\u0009\u0009\u0009<ol><li>Increase the speed change to 2.

How does this affect your motivation to play the game?<\/li>\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009<li>Set the speed change to a value that makes the game more fun for you.  Is it more motivating for you when the game is easier or more difficult?  Do you think everyone will feel the same way?  Why?<\/li><\/ol><\/p>\u0009\u0009<p><\/p>\u0009\u0009\u0009<h2>Adjusting the Conflict<\/h2>\u0009\u0009\u0009<p>All games break down into the essential components of Goals, Conflicts, and Outcomes.  In Prospector Peril, the Goal is to go as fast as you can, the Conflict is to overcome gravity by smashing obstacles, and the Outcome is life or death for the Prospector and speed points for the player.  In this section, we will explore how adjusting the Conflict affects the game play.\u0009\u0009\u0009<ol><li>Click on the EnemyCart sprite and find the block inside Focus Area 4 that adjusts the Cart Speed:  <img src=\".\/images\/cartspeed-block.png\" alt=\"cartspeed-block\"\/>.

Originally, the range was two (5 to 7).  Let's double this by making a range of four with variables 4 to 8.  What effect does this have on the game?<\/li>\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009<li>Continue to adjust the range of cart speed until you think you have optimized it.

The ability to control actions on screen is the core element of making something a mechanic. Beyond that simple definition, mechanics can be anything one can imagine and implement into a game. Of course, game developers have found mixed results when building mechanics. Intentions of how a mechanic will be fun are not always how the final results turn out. At this point in video game development, some basic mechanics have now passed the test of time and hold to be standard mechanics in many games. <em>Walk, Jump, Swing<\/em>, and<em> Slide<\/em> are just some of the most basic and most common.<\/p><p>It is important to remember that not every game needs every mechanic. Designing mechanics in a game should not be like playing jazz. Think of them more as a recipe for a dish. We are looking for the right mechanics in the right amount and combination to create a fun, engaging, interactive experience. Too many ingredients will spoil the meal. There is a limit to how many mechanics a player will be willing to learn, especially if those mechanics do not add to the overall joy of playing the game. For example, a game may offer five different modes of jumping: however, if there is not a compelling in-game reason to master and use all these jumps, they become tiresome and boring.<\/p><p>This Module will take a broad look at different types of game mechanics and how they interact with the player and each other to make up a video game. The Topics will cover:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-mechanics-2\">Common Mechanics in Video Games<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-mechanics-3\">Mechanics vs. Gimmicks<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#game-mechanics-4\">Victory Condition Mechanics<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-mechanics-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Common Mechanics in Video Games<\/h1><p>In this Topic we are going to take a closer look at some common, or standard, mechanics in existing games. First we will examine the goals of the mechanic and then determine if the mechanic is “meaningful” in terms of achieving those goals. Finally, for each category of mechanic, we will look at some examples where mechanics failed in a game or were successful and innovative<\/p><h3>Puzzles<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_puzzle.png\" alt=\"image_puzzle\" width=\"539\" height=\"306\" \/><p>Puzzles are great mechanics for video games. They are perfect tools to achieve design goals in that a well-structured puzzle has clear objectives, clear rules-of-play, and a clear path to improvement of skill. They are also easy to scale difficulty to always offer a challenge to players. One of the most popular and successful puzzle games of all time is <em>Tetris<\/em>. Its design creates “addictive play” because it constantly stimulates the brain's play impulses. Puzzles can also be integrated into other game genres to add gameplay and depth. Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are great examples where puzzles can add to the other mechanics in the game for a richer and more varied experience.<\/p><p>The game <em>Portal <\/em>is a terrific example of blending puzzle elements with a first-person shooter game. In doing so, it innovated how gameplay with puzzles can be new and original. It also integrated a deep storyline and even characters into puzzles.<\/p><h3>Combat<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_combat.png\" alt=\"image_combat\" width=\"556\" height=\"306\" \/><p>Combat is one of the most common and most diverse mechanics in video games. It perfectly utilizes the design philosophy of Objectives (in-game goals), Conflicts (in-game challenges that must be overcome to obtain objectives), and Outcomes (results of conflict). It blends well with character and story for immersion. It also adapts well to the learning curve of skill acquirement that keeps players motivated and interested. Combat can also be structured in many different styles of gameplay. First-person shooter combat is vastly different in gameplay than a real-time strategy war game. Combat mechanics could encompass one-on-one sword-fighting, massive battlefield campaigns, martial arts, and perhaps hundreds of others.<\/p><p>Halo, at the time of its release in late 2001, was hailed as a near perfect demonstration of video game combat mechanics. It seamlessly blended art, story, character, environments, and combat to create a rich and immersive world. Later, other mechanics, such as <em>cover<\/em> (the ability to hide behind an object) became innovations of combat games from the Halo era.<\/p><h3>Simulation<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_simulation.png\" alt=\"image_simulation\" width=\"556\" height=\"306\" \/><p>Simulation games utilize mechanics that mimic real-life experiences. They can include machine Simulations, such as driving cars or flying jet planes, or they can simulate societal events like, world exploration or conquest. Most are interested in creating mechanics that are complex enough to emulate actual complexities of real-life. For example, <em>Civilization V<\/em> has mechanical structures for  complexity and depth of play: food production, human resources, natural resources, economics, science, war, etc. Each of these options creates a cause and effect on each other. It is important to balance how each element affects other elements to create a Simulation that is as realistic as possible but still allows for quality gameplay. For this type of Simulation, a good user interface is crucial. For machine simulators, the mechanical focus is on precision. When the player hits the button to make the car go forward, it has to feel like the control is connected to the car as if the player is actually driving a car. In this regard, reactive controls become a key part of many Simulation games.<\/p><h3>Role-Playing<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_roleplaying.png\" alt=\"image_roleplaying\" width=\"556\" height=\"306\" \/><p>Role-Playing games put the player in someone (or something) else's shoes and allows them to imagine what it would be like to live someone else's life. This premise is often made more intriguing by making that life take place in a wondrous and mysterious world. Often the mechanical goals of a Role-Playing game are drawn from the fantasy world and story line that is created for the game. For example, the in-game mechanics of a medieval fantasy world of sword and sorcery are going to be quite different than a modern world of fashion and careers. Either way, most of the mechanics are going to emphasis exploration of the world and interacting with the players, NPCs and objects within the world. This interaction often integrates additional mechanics such as puzzles and combat. That said, character development is the mechanic that is most unique and important in Role-Playing Games.<\/p><p>There are many different ways to express character development through mechanics; remember, though, the goals are the same as just about any other video game. As video game designers we want to have the player quickly recognize how to navigate through the game world and how to improve the skills needed to succeed in the game.<\/p><p>The Fantasy Role-Playing game series, <em>The Elder Scrolls, is a terrific example of using multiple mechanics that allow a player to explore and develop skills within a world.<\/em>. The series offers combat, exploration, character improvement, and an in-game economy.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-mechanics-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Mechanics and Gimmicks<\/h1><p>Gameplay can be broken down into two categories: Mechanics and Gimmicks.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_MechanicsVSGimmics.png\" alt=\"image_MechanicsVSGimmics\" width=\"817\" height=\"344\" \/><h3>Mechanics<\/h3><p>A mechanic is essential to core gameplay and deeply integrated into design and game structure. The goal of a mechanic is first and foremost be fun. Fun is achieved by balancing difficulty with a player's investment in time and effort and offering incentives to continue playing. Remember our checklist for a good mechanic? We always want to ask: Is it fun? Is it meaningful? Is it necessary?<\/p><h3>Gimmicks<\/h3><p>So what is a gimmick? At their best, gimmicks add flair, style, or some cool-factor to a game, but do not add a significant increase to the game's mechanical design. On the other hand, a bad gimmick is any element that is added to a game to entice players on false pretenses: it adds nothing, or even distracts, from the fun of the game. Most gimmicks, unfortunately, fail far more often than they succeed. They are either desperate attempts to disguise bad design or signs of a lazy and uninspired creative process. This sort of gimmick is most often attempted by marketing teams trying to create excitement for an upcoming game that has some flaws the creators want to hide.<\/p><h3>Gimmick or Ripoff?<\/h3><p>Sometimes a gimmick is just a re-skin. Angry Birds, for example, did not invent any new mechanics. The game simply applied  gimmicks (in this case a new look and a story about birds and pigs) to a castle trebuchet game. This new style happened to make the game much more appealing to a mass audience and opened the door for millions of fans. This was in no way an accident. The cuteness was calculated to make the game more fun without changing a single mechanic. It was a very successful and is now a gimmick that is very common.  Some consider Angry Birds a ripoff of Castle Clout: adding only superficial visual and audio changes. But those changes are exactly what catapulted, pardon the pun, Angry Birds to a higher success than Castle Clout.  Oddly enough, the creators of Castle Clout actually acknowledge Angry Birds and hold no grudges. This is partially because, they also recognize that their game borrowed heavily from other games, as well.<\/p><p>According to Jeff Wofford, one of the developers of Crush the Castle (from Armor Games, makers of Castle Clout)<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_gimmics.png\" alt=\"image_gimmics\" width=\"734\" height=\"208\" \/><p>“<i>Sure, Angry Birds took elements from Crush the Castle. But those elements were hardly novel or innovative. Crush the Castle borrowed from many previous games. Castle Clout is the most obvious example (obvious because the Crush the Castle credits give them a shout-out), but the general idea of allowing the user to smash buildings dates back to Rampage or even earlier.”<\/i><\/p><h3>Other Gimmicks<\/h3><p>Not all gimmicks are controversial. Knowing that microtransactions are unpopular with fans when they allow people to purchase in-game power and advantages, Valve's Team Fortress 2 instead offers gimmicks in the form of custom hats and weapons. These items do not give extra power or advantage to the player, but do offer customized character styles and looks. It offers a completely optional and non-game changing payment model for the game without altering the core mechanics of the first-person shooter model. This model has been very successful for Valve; bringing in $139 million in micro-transactions in 2013, according to some analysts (http:\/\/www.superdataresearch.com\/).<\/p><p>Gimmicks fail far more often than they succeed. All too often, they are tagged on as bells and whistles that don't actually add anything to the fun or quality of the game. At their worst, gimmicks actually take away from the entertainment value of a game. This sort of gimmick is most often attempted by marketing teams trying to create excitement for an upcoming game that has some flaws the creators want to hide. Consider a game that plays just like <em>Angry Birds<\/em> but with poorly animated frogs and ducks: this would also be a gimmick, but now, a bad one. Whether a gimmick is good or not can be subjective. A good rule of thumb is if a gimmick is not at least original it should probably not be used.<\/p>&nbsp;<\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"game-mechanics-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Victory Condition Mechanics<\/h1><p>Let's look more closely at a common mechanic in most all games: the Victory Condition. Just like it sounds, this mechanic determines if and when a player has won or lost. Seems simple, right? Actually, there are alternatives to the simple victory condition formula. In this topic we are going to examine in detail, defined victory conditions, Game over conditions, and even games that never end.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_win-300x201.png\" alt=\"image_win\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" \/><p>Victory conditions can vary greatly from game to game; but, usually when a victory condition is achieved the game ends. Note, however, that victory conditions are not always the same as game-over conditions. Sometimes games have defined victory conditions, and some have undefined victory conditions, while some many have none at all.<\/p><h3>Games with Defined Victory Conditions<\/h3><p>Most games provide a clear victory condition for players to work towards. As stressed earlier, it is important to give players clearly defined mechanics they must master as well as a not too difficult to identify path to victory. That doesn't mean the mechanics to achieve victory have to be boring. Chess for example is fairly simple in its mechanics and the victory objective (take the King) is clear and simple. Actually achieving the victory condition in a good game of chess can be a bit more challenging. It is the brilliant design of chess that also allows the mechanics to inform and alter the players' perception of how close each of them is to achieving victory over the course of the game. In other words, in chess, the closer one player comes to victory, the easier it becomes and the more obvious it becomes.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_wincondition.png\" alt=\"image_wincondition\" width=\"739\" height=\"488\" \/><p>In chess, each player goes through a series of lesser victory conditions that built toward the ultimate objective of taking the king. In video games, we can create similar rules for games with multiple layers and systems, but the basic victory condition mechanic stays similar enough that the structure has merit. Take for example the computer game <em>Civilization V. <\/em>Players each have a broad understanding of certain victory conditions they must achieve to win the game. When those conditions have been met, the game will be over.<\/p><h3>Games with Game-Over Conditions<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_gameover.png\" alt=\"image_gameover\" width=\"530\" height=\"403\" \/><p>Not all games are trying to push the player to a game-over condition through victory conditions. Some games will even practically go on forever if the player achieves perfection in achieving victory conditions. In these games, the design goals are to create game-over conditions. Most of the classic arcade games of the 1980s used this type of mechanic. For example, in the arcade game <em>Asteroids, <\/em>victory conditions were fulfilled by surviving the level, but the game did not end. A new wave of asteroids was always ready to begin the challenge again. For games like this, the game-over condition is more important. Players will typically only have a certain number of mistakes they can make before the game ends. If the gameplay was fun and engaging, they will not care that the goals of the game are repetitive; they will want to play again and improve their skill level.<\/p><h3>The Never Ending Story<\/h3><p>Some games want none of those pesky victory conditions or game-over conditions. For some games, the experience of the game is about exploration, growth and socialization. Social media games often fall under this category. Many games are built around the concept of creating an ever growing and improving “theme park” of some kind: farm, carnival, zoo, etc. They don't have defined victory conditions because there is no real winner or loser – only degrees of prosperity. In addition, there is no game-over mechanic threatening to end the game if the player makes a misstep.<\/p><p>Sometimes this mechanic is blurred for the sake of emergence. For example, in <em>World of Warcraft<\/em>, players do have victory conditions that feel like achievements and allow for character growth, but the threats do not actually ever create a game-over condition. The player is merely inconvenienced (or otherwise penalized) and then allowed to continue playing.<\/p><h3>Going Forward: Emergence and Complexity<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_future.png\" alt=\"image_future\" width=\"618\" height=\"279\" \/><p>From here, game mechanics become vastly more multifaceted. Now that the basics of game mechanics have been introduced, the truly complicated structures begin to take shape to create emergence and complexity. Simply put, this is where we begin layer simple mechanics to create interconnected choices for the player. It is important to remember that this is not dependent on complex rules but rather simple rules that combine to create complex behavior in the game design.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~game-mechanics-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference

In other words, the \"art\" isn't complete without the player interaction that creates something more than the sum of code, art, story, sound effects, and mechanics. In this view, the art of a video game isn't a complete experience until the game is played and its “true artistry” is discovered through interacting with the game.<\/p><p>Another aspect to consider is that interacting with a video game creates a unique aesthetic experience for the player that may be entirely different than someone else's. The options presented in game mechanics or the narrative are individually chosen to create a different user experience for each person that plays the game, and often a different experience each time the game is played. Unlike a movie, the aesthetics of a video game are more layered and dependent upon more factors than anything that has come before.<\/p><p>As video game developers, we are creating art as well as entertainment and it is important to remember why certain design theories work and some don't. We must understand how and why an audience approaches a video game as opposed to a book or a movie. These are what we call the Common design theories in video game development<\/p><p>This Module will explore these common game design theories and will include:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#common-design-theories-2\">Fundamentals of Game Design<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#common-design-theories-3\">The Importance of Balance in Gameplay<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#common-design-theories-4\">The Impact of User Experience on Game Design<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#common-design-theories-5\">Elements and Principles in Visual Design<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"common-design-theories-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Fundamentals of Game Design<\/h1><p>Video games are unique forms of art and entertainment. They are not just for an audience using their senses to contemplate an image, idea, or sound: video games allow a deeper interaction, which demands its own set of foundations. Some of these considerations are the same any art form would contemplate, others, however, are absolutely exclusive to video games.<\/p><h2>Audience<\/h2><p>Having an <em>audience<\/em> is not just a matter of knowing and targeting a particular demographic that has excessive free time and money to spend. When discussing video game design, we must understand what the audience expectations of experiencing a video game has become. “Gamers” are savvy people who have formed definite opinions on video game narratives and mechanics up to this point in history. Taking outdated ideas such as 'girls like pink' and 'boys like blue' and then using pink visuals in your game to target girls or blue visuals to target an audience of boys is not enough. Audience, in terms of game theory is more about player psychology than pure aesthetics or genre preference. For design purposes, we are concerned about holding their interest.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_demographics.jpg\" alt=\"image_demographics\" width=\"670\" height=\"401\" \/><p>Game theory as it relates to developing and maintaining an Audience can be abstract and complex. We will cover some of the more complex game design theories in later Modules, but for now, understand that Audience immersion and player psychology are keys to the basic functionality of a game as well as making the game entertaining.<\/p><h2>Platform<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_platforms.png\" alt=\"image_platforms\" width=\"809\" height=\"306\" \/><p>We have already discussed various <em>platforms<\/em> and their similarities and differences; now we are going to touch on how platform choice also affects game design. Platforms each come with their own benefits and limitations: for the player the most obvious differences are the input devices associated with different platforms. This is an important consideration for the game designer. Will the player use a keyboard or a console controller? What buttons will be used and how? If the game is cross-platform, will gameplay be drastically more difficult on one type of input device over another? This is just one impact platform will have on game design. Others may include which game engine to use to build the game, what built-in audiences are associated with a particular platform and what fee and\/or restrictions are part of creating a game for a platform. In short, the choice of platform will have profound impact on game design in many ways.<\/p><h2>Genre<\/h2><p><em>Genres don't help market a game &#8211; instead, the selection of a genre has an effect on what (and what size of) audience is likely to be interested and willing to purchase a game.<\/em> Genres do help  an audience understand the basics of a game by promising them a certain amount of familiar elements they desire (or demand) in a particular genre. For example, fans of medieval fantasy will expect some common themes in a Fantasy Real-Time Strategy game (FRTS): knights, castles, troop combat, and magic, to name a few. As a game designer, it is important to understand what kind of audience expectations exist across different genres. Stray too far from these expectations without designing a brilliant alternative and the game will lose its audience. Stick too close to what has come before and the game will be overlooked as offering nothing new. Even the bold designer that intends on rewriting all that we know about how a genre game is played, needs to understand what, to this point, has made the genre popular before deconstructing it and making it better.<\/p><h2>Rules and Mechanics<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_actions.png\" alt=\"image_actions\" width=\"828\" height=\"281\" \/><p>There are countless theories on the best <em>rules and mechanics<\/em> for video games. On a more pragmatic level, video game audiences filter out bad mechanics by not purchasing poorly designed games. That said, there is no perfect mechanic for every game. Designing good rules and mechanics is a balancing act of practical needs, player psychology and fun. For example, jumping is a common video game mechanic, but is it fun? The answer depends on why the player is jumping, how fast they are getting good at jumping, and how integrated being a good jumper affects the fun and goals of the game. If jumping is repetitive, meaningless, or too easy (or too hard), then it could be an awful mechanic for a game.<\/p><p>It is best to think of mechanics abstractly, and not as a rigid set of controller options. They are a means to an end and should be used as such, and not as sacred cows that must be avoided or always utilized. There are still ways to “reinvent the wheel”, in game mechanics, but that, in and of itself, is a poor design goal. Good design is finding the best mechanics for a particular game, or building a great game around a particular mechanic goal. In a later Course, we will look much closer at theoretical abstracts in game design mechanics, but for now, understanding what a game wants to accomplish as far as mechanics, is a good place to start.<\/p><h2>Challenges<\/h2><p>A <em>challenge<\/em> is what makes a game an interactive experience, as opposed to a book or a movie. Although a deep and well-constructed movie or book can challenge the intellect, games present both intellectual and physical challenges. The viewer is also a doer in the sense that their interactions change the experience, the aesthetics, and make the game unique every time it is experienced. From a gameplay point of view, challenges are the bread and butter of mechanic design. Everything a player must do in a video game is, in a way, a challenge. Simply walking a character across the screen is still a challenge in terms of learning what “buttons” to push to make the character go. This also illustrates that not every challenge remains challenging for long. The key to challenges is making them balanced with difficulty and enticing players to want to take them on with a sense of purpose in overcoming them. A player who has defeated a properly balanced challenge will feel confident in their skills and will want to face the next challenge. A poorly balanced challenge will frustrate the player and cause them to want to avoid gameplay that leads to more disappointment in the game.<\/p><h2>Incentives<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_incentives.png\" alt=\"image_incentives\" width=\"632\" height=\"405\" \/><p><em>Incentives<\/em> are ways to make players seek out challenges. An incentive is any positive reinforcement of good gameplay from a player. For example, completing a difficult level on a 2D platform game, requiring intense jumping challenges, might offer unlocking a double-jump mechanic. This in turn, will make previous jumping challenges easier, as well as allowing for more complex and difficult levels to come. Incentives come in many different forms, depending on the type of game and genre. Some incentives are abstract, while some are called out in the rules of the game. Role-playing games (RPGs) often have experience points, which are built in incentives, the players can know ahead of time, plan on, and plan ahead for just by playing the game. The game tells them that by playing more, they will become better at it, even sometimes going as far as giving them a little experience point countdown on when they will improve next. Now, the closer the player gets to “making a level” and once again improving, the more incentive they have to continue playing to achieve that goal. It gets much more complex from here, and we will cover incentives much deeper in a later Course.<\/p><h2>Playability<\/h2><p><em>Playability<\/em> is a combination of mechanics, interface and control. These three elements must weave together well to create playability. Playability comes even before fun. If a game is frustrating because of playability issues such as, poor button response or a difficult user interface, it will never be fun, no matter how smart and original it is. Playability is also very difficult to get right just from a writing standpoint. It is all well and good to declare excellent playability in the game design document; however, actually achieving playability is quite another set of challenges. Playability will often be maximized in QA testing, where bugs in the control, interface, and gameplay can be altered for a better user experience. That said, good game designers will not let testing completely dictate playability design. Even though it will be refined as the game develops, understanding playability issues is a good place to start when first designing a new game.<\/p><h2>Content<\/h2><p><em>Content<\/em> is what really separates one game from another, even in similar genres selling to similar audiences. Content is usually the first thing people look for when deciding whether or not to buy a new game. New mechanics can be exciting (if they are fun and meaningful) but it is content that makes or breaks a game. Content can be further broken down into quantity, quality and originality.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_originality.png\" alt=\"image_originality\" width=\"345\" height=\"259\" \/><p>Sometimes a game can offer awesome new mechanics, amazing visuals, and sound, but then falls short on content quantity. That is to say, the game is short and lacking enough content to make the game feel worth the purchase price. There are many design tricks (some say dirty tricks) one can use to expand content quantity, such as “grinding”, “back-tracking”, or even “expansive retrieval quests”. These are typically used in games to make their worlds seem bigger than they are. They are also tricks used in games that otherwise would end too soon without them. Other games can present too few mechanical options and quickly become boring. Content quantity is going to be a balance of time, budget and design goals.<\/p><p>Quality implies that the game works as advertised and demonstrates at least basic competency in delivering a playable game. That may not seem like a lofty goal, however, it is more difficult than imagined. Poor design for quality can create the need to make short cuts or cut features in order to maintain quality. Even games with quality can also fail from offering too little content (quantity) or too little originality.<\/p><p>Original content is always in demand, but it will always be judged on “what works” rather than “what's new”. New titles must always offer at least some originality over sequels. Sequels can expand concepts, while new titles must establish their own. Here is the most dangerous aspect of designing new mechanics: should mechanics be new just for the sake of being new? That is to say, if a mechanic is new, it must, more than ever, pass the design test of: Is it meaningful, is it fun? Often, with a truly original mechanic, its final interactions are going to be guessed at in the early stages of game design. Here is where rapid prototyping (discussed in a later Module) comes in handy.<\/p><h2>Visuals and Sound<\/h2><p><em>Visuals and sound<\/em> have a design component as well. Both should be used to articulate and accentuate the design goals of the game. Angry Birds, without the brilliant visual and sound design is just another catapult game with nothing new to offer. In fact, in many ways the visuals and sound of Angry Birds are the only new offerings the game makes. Mechanically it plays exactly the same as a host of other games just like it, just with different visuals and sound. So why did Angry Birds succeed so dramatically while others failed? Angry Birds was the seamless blend of simple gameplay and aesthetics that fit perfectly to a new platform (smartphones), a new audience (casual gamers), and just cute enough original design in visuals and sound.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"common-design-theories-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Importance of Balance in Gameplay<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_balance.png\" alt=\"image_balance\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Much of the challenge in game design is in achieving balance in gameplay. Balance means the game's difficulty, fairness, pacing, challenges, and controls all work in tandem to give a seamless, cohesive experience to the player. Here the psychology of game play comes to the forefront and demands certain considerations.<\/p><h2>Difficulty<\/h2><p>It is important to remember, a difficult video game is not necessarily a good or a bad thing. Different audiences seek different levels of difficulty in their games of choice. Casual games, such as most phone and tablet designed games, generally seek a lower range of difficulty than, say, PC games.<em> Difficulty<\/em> in any game can be mitigated or increased by making certain design decisions. The true goal in mastering difficulty is understanding the player's psyche when playing games.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_difficulty.png\" alt=\"image_difficulty\" width=\"700\" height=\"479\" \/><p>In general, players expect a learning curve when playing a new game. Their sense of difficulty, beyond controller reaction, is going to be based on how they are asked to learn a new skill. Jumping the final platforms of a game's finale should pose an overwhelming difficulty if the players just skipped ahead past all the earlier levels. It is by slowly staging skill improvement that when a player reaches the final level its difficulty is a challenge but not impossible, and thus overcoming the challenge is then rewarding.<\/p><p>This balance is hard to gage for every single player that may play the game. Some are simply going to find the difficulty balance is off for them. Some games design ways to alter or change their difficulty. Some do this simply by allowing the player to adjust the difficulty as they wish. Doing so does offer a player to customize difficulty for their own enjoyment, however, doing so often ruins the balance the other way (making it too easy) and the player grows bored and leaves the game anyway.<\/p><p>Some games tackle difficulty by replacing player skill mastery with player character skill mastery. In this type of game, the players do not need to improve a skill themselves, improvement is integrated into the player's avatar. For example, instead of having to constantly practice aiming a crossbow to improve at it, the game might assign the player character a percentage chance of success based on hardcoded character improvement paths. As the character gains “experience levels” their percentage to hit a target automatically goes up.<\/p><h2>Fairness<\/h2><p><em>Fairness<\/em> is a concept often used in talking about player vs player (PvP) games. In these games, it is important not to give one player a statistical advantage over another player. For games that present class systems, this balance can be quite difficult. Players can easily follow a less difficult path through the game, or make mistakes when able to improve their character's skills in the game. This can create unintended imbalance due to different levels of game mastery by the players. Those that want to invest more time can become significantly better at playing the game than casual players. This can be through actual mastery of the game or it could just be through exploitation of balance issues in the design itself. This might seem fair enough, however, from a design point of view, we don't want people feeling left behind and “lesser” than the hardcore players. They might grow bored or frustrated at what is required of them to be competitive and that will affect the game's market success.<\/p><p>Solutions to fairness issues can be harsh to hardcore fans and difficult to implement. Often, when a game developer sees fairness issues in their game, the only solutions are to “nerf” or \"buff\" the mechanics to some degree. Nerf is a slang term for downgrading the stats of something in the game to help even out fairness, while buffing is a term for upgrading stats. In the RPG example, an overpowered or underpowered class might be nerfed or buffed to bring the class closer in line with the power of other classes. Of course, this has the potential of throwing every other class out of balance as well as making people angry that their favorite class has changed. When fans feel their favorite class is nerfed too much, they may accuse the developer of “gimping” the class. That is, they feel the changes have the opposite effect of balance and simply make the class undesirable to play.<\/p><p>Real solutions to fairness are going to be step by step processes, which have various levels of success and failure in terms of finding the right balance of fairness.<\/p><h2>Pacing<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_pacing.png\" alt=\"image_pacing\" width=\"468\" height=\"380\" \/><p>Designers put a lot of work in setting the <em>pace<\/em> of gameplay. Pace determines how long the game will last while maintaining a high level of entertainment from start to finish. Unfortunately, pacing is in many ways out of the control of designers.  For example, from a skill mastery position, different players are going to take various amounts of time to learn a skill. For simple 2D platform games, repetition is the solution; however, this makes it difficult to estimate the hours of gameplay a title offers. In addition, there is unpredictable player behavior that will also seriously undermine pacing and how the designer originally intended the game to be played. Pacing problems often occur in player vs environment (PvE) games, where exploration is encouraged. For these games, the player largely is in control of the game's pace. This leaves room for the player to play in ways that are not necessarily wrong, but have unintended consequences in terms of pacing.<\/p><p>For example, an open world RPG may allow players to explore anywhere in the world at any time. This is positive in terms of players being unrestricted in how they want to explore the game, however, it also opens the door for them to become overwhelmed, lost, or missing key points in the game Also, by wandering away from intended design, players risk missing important parts of the game and become frustrated or bored.<\/p><h2>Work and Reward<\/h2><p>Although good design will hide this fact, players of video games are required to do <em>work.<\/em> The reason players accept this work is because they perceive some<em> reward<\/em> for doing so. Most often this reward is “fun”. The labor to get better at the game is rewarded by the enjoyment of fulfilling goals within the game. At the most basic level, good design aims at making the experience fun. Being fun is a tremendous motivator to play a game and perhaps the most obvious. Beyond being fun, there are other player motivators in good game design, many of which are subtle and buried in gameplay.<\/p><p>No matter what tricks a game uses as player motivations, the concept remains the same: the game must offer the player rewards as they play to foster continued growth in skill and exploration of the game.  Games that lack work motivators in the form of rewards quickly become tedious, pointless, and boring. At the same time, games that offer too much reward can also become too easy and boring. Video game designers have, over the years, created a host of theories, tricks, and methodologies to address and implement player motivation. In almost all cases, player motivation breaks down to simple player psychology of seeking rewards for completing tasks. This simple concept pattern can then be repeated in “loops” and stacked upon each other to create larger circles of player work and reward. In a later Module, we will take this concept to another level of complexity, but for now, understanding the basic, but vastly important, concept of fostering player motivation through rewards is crucial to good game design.<\/p><h2>Creative vs. Mechanical<\/h2><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_CreativeVSMechanical.png\" alt=\"image_CreativeVSMechanical\" width=\"802\" height=\"332\" \/><p>It is a mistake to focus game design entirely on<em> mechanics<\/em>. As mentioned with the Angry Birds example, <em>creative<\/em> design (in this case, art and sound design) can be just as important. Story, character, and visual themes do more than just add colorful elements to a game; they create points of immersion and their own set of motivators for play. Without a story, a first-person shooter game becomes a pointless excuse for violence. Without characters and setting, a fantasy MMO becomes a clone war of pure number crunching. There is no magical number that can be given to exactly balance creative vs. mechanical elements in any particular game. Each must be given equal consideration and then balanced for the goals of the game. Just keep in mind; games like Pac-Man succeed because they are not just a maze mechanic, but because they also create joy in the experience through character and story design.<\/p><p>We will further discuss Story and Characters in video games in more detail in upcoming Modules.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"common-design-theories-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Impact of User Experience on Game Design<\/h1><p>The goal of making a video game, in the most general sense, is to create a user experience. The tricky part is, designing mechanics is mostly guesswork until the systems are tested. That said, there are certain criteria we can follow to avoid the biggest pitfalls of negative user experience. In the video game industry, these are commonly called The Keys to Usability. These keys help developers increase quality and reduced development costs by planning ahead.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_UserExperience.png\" alt=\"image_UserExperience\" width=\"530\" height=\"472\" \/><h2>Keys to Usability<\/h2><p><em>Usability i<\/em>s a term used to describe how fluid and functional a game is to play. It measures consistency, simplicity, and efficiency in design. We can use Keys to Usability as a checklist of broad but universal design goals every game should strive for. They also help define some design standards that can be checked for during usability testing. While different game makers might organize and title them a little differently, the following covers the basic concepts of ensuring usability.<\/p><h3>Seamlessness<\/h3><p><em>Seamlessness<\/em> is our first goal for usability. Playing a video game is meant to be an immersive experience. That means we want to avoid things that unnecessarily pull players attention from the game as we want to present it. The most glaring issue that can detract from seamlessness is glitches. Glitches are unintended programming errors that instantly, and often visually, break the spell of the game. Once the veil of the coding is revealed through a glitch, it becomes difficult for the player to get lost in intended design. Poor controller response can also ruin seamlessness. Other non-technical problems can be additional obstructions to seamlessness. Bad storytelling, poor character dialog, or incoherent visual themes can easily jolt a player from their focused engagement with the game. For seamlessness to occur, all of the elements of mechanics, story, visuals, and sound must blend together without showing the audience the man behind the curtain.<\/p><h3>Usefulness<\/h3><p><em>Usefulness <\/em>is another important consideration for any design element put into a game. Concepts should never be tossed into a game with no forethought as to how those concepts will make the game better, as opposed to just bigger. Mechanics that are not useful, or meaningful, become tiresome for the player, as they offer no tangible purpose to master and no reward. Non-mechanical usefulness is also important. Visuals work better if they convey concise messages of the world rather than a random assortment of unrelated or tossed in images. Visuals display their own usefulness in that they help guide the player through obstacles in the game world. Any visuals that confuse that guidance fail in usefulness.<\/p><h3>Desirability<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_desirability.png\" alt=\"image_desirability\" width=\"616\" height=\"412\" \/><p><em>Desirability<\/em> asks the question: will anyone want to play this? A desirable game will have a sense of something new, be exciting to play, encourage players to play to the end and have friendly, meaningful mechanics. Evaluating desirability is a matter of asking direct questions of the experience. How did x make you feel? What is your reaction to x? With this sort of questioning, developers can evaluate positive and negative areas of the game's attraction to an audience.<\/p><h3>Overall Elegance<\/h3><p>In video game terms, <em>Overall Elegance<\/em>, is the balance between rules complexity and ease of play. A game is considered elegant if its rule set is simple enough for the player to instantly (or nearly so) begin to play. This is done by giving the player clear options to explore the game without having to work too hard at discovering how they work. Elegance means the game's design meets the core design goals of keeping a player immersed and learning the game as intended.<\/p><h2>Usability Testing<\/h2><p>By using the keys of usability checklist, we can avoid many usability issues &#8211; on a theoretical basis. The concepts make sense and should help us minimize problems. The lingering problem is, we just don't know for sure. That is where usability testing comes into play. Usability testing lets us evaluate the game's effectiveness in engaging an audience, its efficiency in delivering its concepts, and players' satisfaction in playing it. It mitigates glitches, player frustration, and any other problems in the game's design and implementation. Mostly it pinpoints the true user experience and allows time and a process to correct any problems that create a negative user experience. For video games, this is an extremely important process, as user satisfaction is really the difference between success and failure. Remember, gamers are only going to put up with usability issues so much before they simply move on to another, less frustrating game.<\/p><h3>Expert Review<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_expertreview-300x199.png\" alt=\"image_expertreview\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" \/><p>So usability testing is important, now, how do we do it? One way is through <em>expert review<\/em>. Developers and game experts take a red pen to the GDD and mark out known and unknown issues and then rank those issues according to severity. The review teams then meet and discuss possible solutions. The value of this method is that it is quick and can be done multiple times throughout the development process. It is also a very flexible process that can be scaled according to issues of greatest importance. Expert review often involves rapid prototyping, which is a sort of pen and paper testing of concepts, UI design, and other instant evaluation techniques (we will expand on rapid prototyping in a later Module).  The end results are well worth the effort as this kind of scrutiny can reveal many usability problems with good use of time and personnel.<\/p><h3>Playtesting<\/h3><p><em>Playtesting<\/em> is another form of usability testing. Usually this involves allowing an early version of the game to a limited group of gamers to try out and find usability issues. This type of usability testing goes straight to the audience that may purchase the game and gets their opinions on what works and what doesn't. Generally, players testing a game give honest, yet sometimes harsh, evaluations on whether or not they would want to play the game and detailed descriptions on why or why not. This is a group that genuinely wants good games on the market and has familiarity in evaluating their own user experiences. Remember, this is not QA testing, this is much more limited in scope. Test groups are usually less than ten people who are drawn from the game's target demographic and often testing is done in a “lab”, in a controlled environment, as opposed to loosely tested at home.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"common-design-theories-5\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Elements and Principles of Visual Design<\/h1><p>Creating visuals for video games is an art form unto itself. The contribution of visuals to a game is, in many ways, as essential as mechanics and programming. The instantaneous mental effect of imagery in a game has an incredible amount of influence on a player's perception of a game regardless of how well the game plays. Poor visuals in a game can ruin its popularity, while terrific visuals can make a mechanically boring game a hit. Professional artists are masters of seeing the art within the art and will often break down visual design into two very broad categories: Elements and Principles.<\/p><h2>Elements of Visual Design<\/h2><p>We can broadly think of the elements of visual design as the building blocks of art. They are the elements every piece of art will incorporate.<\/p><h3>Value<\/h3><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_value1.png\" alt=\"image_value1\" width=\"592\" height=\"340\" \/><p><em>Value<\/em> is an extremely important and a sometimes confusing element of visual design for non-artists. Value describes a range of gray between perfect white and perfect black. White on this scale is given a value of zero and black is given a value of 10. The 1 to 9 values are all shades of gray ranging from light to dark gray. Art professionals can usually identify the exact value of any gray by using this scale.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_value2.png\" alt=\"image_value2\" width=\"1209\" height=\"382\" \/><p>Why is Value important? Value is how the eye separates one detail in an image from another. Without value images have no distinction and even color is worthless and washed out. One trick artists do to evaluate value is to remove all color from an image (remember video game artists use a digital art medium) and examine the image purely in “gray-scale”. This allows them to see the true value of a piece.<\/p><h3>Color<\/h3><p><em>Color<\/em> (or hue) is an obvious element in visual design, but here again; we find there is a sort of art science to its usage. Artists refer to what is known as <em>color theory <\/em>and the color wheel when discussing color.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_color1.png\" alt=\"image_color1\" width=\"615\" height=\"334\" \/><p>By examining the color wheel, we can see how colors compliment and contrast each other. First we can identify the primary colors (red, yellow, and blue). Between the primary colors are the secondary colors (green, orange, and violet). Then between each primary and secondary color we have the tertiary colors (blue violet, yellow orange, etc.).<\/p><p>Artists learn how to use color theory to create proper color compositions. By referring to the color wheel they learn which color combinations work well together and which blend into hues that turn the stomach. We can also look to nature, the perfect example of color theory in motion, to further our understanding. Examine a sunset, a bird, a flower, or even a fish and notice how they each follow color theory, or rather perhaps, how color theory conforms to nature.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_color2.gif\" alt=\"image_color2\" width=\"705\" height=\"224\" \/><p>&nbsp;<\/p><h3>Line<\/h3><p><em>Line<\/em> is a very basic element of art that actually has a very complex and powerful purpose. As in math, a line is a series of points that combine in their closeness to create a new thing.  For artists, lines are used to create emotion and manipulate the eye of the beholder through direction. By using vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines an artist can guide the eye and create dynamics and action in the piece.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_lines.png\" alt=\"image_lines\" width=\"765\" height=\"351\" \/><h3>Shape<\/h3><p><em>Shape<\/em> is the form inside a connected series of lines. Color and value help define shape. Shapes are either geometric (square, circle, etc.) or organic (non-geometric or free-formed). Silhouettes are iconic shapes that represent an actual thing. The shape of Batman's cowl is an example of an iconic silhouette. It is instantly powerful and recognizable as uniquely belonging to Batman. Shape can also be described as positive or negative. A positive shape automatically contrasts itself against its negative opposite creating a value scale.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_shapes1.png\" alt=\"image_shapes1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"314\" \/><h3>Size<\/h3><p><em>Size<\/em> is a comparison of two or more shapes in terms of the space they occupy in the image. By making shapes different sizes the artist can (via height, width, line thickness and depth in 3D art) provide information, convey emphasis, and create contrast in the image.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_size.png\" alt=\"image_size\" width=\"994\" height=\"412\" \/><h3>Texture<\/h3><p><em>Texture i<\/em>s an extremely important art element in video games. Texture describes the look and feel of a surface. In video game terms, textures are, in the most basic sense, images mapped to geometry. For many games, textures make up most of what the player sees: grass, earth, concrete, sky, clothing, the shine on a bouncy ball, they are all textures, or art images attached to a shape or 3D object. Textures are often painted as single images that replicate to create the illusion of a texture, such as a patch of green grass. Good textures in a video game are close to seamless and add a certain lushness to the visuals.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_texture.png\" alt=\"image_texture\" width=\"723\" height=\"266\" \/><h2>Principles of Design<\/h2><p>Now that we have briefly covered the elements of visual design, what do we do with them? Right now, these elements are just our building blocks to create visuals. What we are still missing are application techniques to best utilize our elements. Proper use of visual design principles will turn our building blocks into wondrous works or beauty.<\/p><h3>Composition<\/h3><p>The location or arrangement of visual elements in a work of art is called <em>composition.<\/em> It describes how art elements are put together to create a comprehensive and coherent design. In video games, composition is crucial. Think of a user interface: the placement of screens, buttons and player information are all affected by composition. So, how do we create good composition? Let's look at some other design principles.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_compositon1.gif\" alt=\"image_compositon1\" width=\"1161\" height=\"370\" \/><h3>Balance<\/h3><p><em>Balance<\/em> implies equilibrium and symmetry. That doesn't mean every half of an image must be a mirror image of itself. What it means is that the entirety of the composition should be a balance of overall eye pleasing aesthetics. In this sense, balance can be seen as formal (perfect symmetry) or informal (imperfect but still balanced). Informal balance creates dramatic focus of attention in the viewer and allows the artist to, again, manipulate where the eye is lead. Balance can also be divided into three broad categories: horizontal balance, vertical balance, and radial balance.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_balance1.png\" alt=\"image_balance1\" width=\"740\" height=\"368\" \/><h3>Gradation<\/h3><p><em>Gradation<\/em> refers to a subtle change in size, value, color or other visual element that is visually obvious if one looks at the beginning and end of the gradation. Artist use gradation to, once again, lead the viewer's eye and thinking when looking at an image. Gradation can lead the eye in a linear pattern through gradients in size or direction. It can transition colors from cool to warm. Gradation is also useful in creating an illusion of motion in a shape or keeping the eye fixated on a shape.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_gradients1.png\" alt=\"image_gradients1\" width=\"806\" height=\"285\" \/><h3>Harmony<\/h3><p><em>Harmony <\/em>is an achievement of element aesthetics. A harmonic image is one that combines related elements (similar colors, shapes, etc.) in an eye pleasing way. This is not as subjective as it may sound. Remember our color wheel: some color combinations are complementary and “pop” while others over saturate the image.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_harmony.png\" alt=\"image_harmony\" width=\"629\" height=\"275\" \/><h3>Contrast<\/h3><p>The use of opposite or juxtaposing elements in an image creates <em>contrast.<\/em> Opposite colors on the color wheel, for example, can contrast. We can also see contrast in value ranges with the extremes being black and white. Contrast can be a difficult principle to work properly. Too much, or improper use of contrast can weaken visual unity and become chaos for the eye to take in. That said, good use of contrast can center the attention of the viewer and create a delicate harmony in the composition.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_contrast.png\" alt=\"image_contrast\" width=\"511\" height=\"264\" \/><h3>Unity<\/h3><p>The idea of<em> unity<\/em> is that elements should accentuate the ideas being expressed in the visual design. The simplest example of messing up unity would be if an artist placed unrelated images into a single confusing piece of art. For example, a fish or a rainbow in an image of an exploding volcano would generally disrupt the image's unity. In addition to using elements to create unity, various principles can be useful, as well. In our volcano example, using diagonal lines can create a feeling of motion in the lava and value can add to the foreboding tone of the piece.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_unity.png\" alt=\"image_unity\" width=\"740\" height=\"244\" \/><h3>Emphasis<\/h3><p><em>Emphasis<\/em> is another principle used to create focus on a visual design where the artist wants it. Emphasis deals with the concept of visual dominance. Dominance dictates where the eye looks first, which the artist can then use other principles to lead their eye through the entire image. Good emphasis grabs the viewer's attention immediately and gives them a starting point to explore the image.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_emphasis.png\" alt=\"image_emphasis\" width=\"716\" height=\"161\" \/><h3>Proportion<\/h3><p><em>Proportion<\/em> is the harmony an image has in relationship to each of its elements. Character art is a great way to look at proportion. Often video games and cartoons develop character designs that emphasize disproportional anatomy: oversized hands, feet, and heads. This warping of proportion creates its own style that works in context of making characters stand out on screen. In general, though, proportion is going to be more constrained. Artists often use what is called the Rule of Thirds, which is a way of dividing the image space so that proportions can be accurately estimated. Think of the image space divided into nine equal blocks. Now we have a better reference point to ensure proper proportions. Another visual example of proportion is the nautilus-like triangle graph.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_proportion.png\" alt=\"image_proportion\" width=\"739\" height=\"329\" \/><h3>Proximity<\/h3><p><em>Proximity<\/em> describes how elements are grouped or placed in relationship to each other to create a coherent image. The principle states that similar objects should be grouped to convey they are seen as a group, and that objects that are close to each other are to be viewed as related. It plays on the psychology of the viewer and attempts to make the relationship of proximity obvious.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_proximity.png\" alt=\"image_proximity\" width=\"722\" height=\"328\" \/><h3>Repetition<\/h3><p><em>Repetition<\/em> of elements creates unity and a general sense of cohesiveness in an image. In video games, repetition is extensively used to create massive textures and worlds. In many ways, repetition is the opposite of contrast, in that it allows the player to imagine what they are seeing as part of a larger whole. The key is repetition is hiding it. If repetition of an element becomes obvious, it has failed in its purpose.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_repetition.png\" alt=\"image_repetition\" width=\"648\" height=\"277\" \/><\/div><!--page:~~common-design-theories-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":".\/exercise\/DevProRattyFlap.stack","instructions":"        <h1>Goal<\/h1>        <p>            In this Exercise, we will be demonstrating a Tight Concept made popular by the game <em>Flappy Bird<\/em> by setting up the same simple core gameplay elements in our own version, <em>Ratty Flap<\/em>.        <\/p>        <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/game-structure-tightconcept-gamesnap-exercise_1.png\" alt=\"game-structure-tightconcept-gamesnap-exercise_1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" \/><p style=\"text-align: center;\">The final game should look similar to the one in this image.<\/p>        <h1>Steps<\/h1>        <p>All work in this Exercise will be done in the <em>Stage<\/em> area and <em>BatRat<\/em> sprite within the Tight Concept exercise.<\/p>        <ol>            <li>First, let's see what the Exercise looks like without modification.

Many kids grow up dreaming of being an athlete, actor, or singer; a new generation is growing up wanting to make video games as a profession. Similar to other entertainment industries, developing a video game requires individuals that specialize in various creative, management, and technical positions. As we go through each career path, we will examine the background requirements, competition, and salary expectations for a number of common positions in game development. Specifically we will cover the following Topics in the Careers in Game Development Module:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-2\">Role of a Game Designer<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-3\">Role of a Video Game Programmer<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-4\">Role of a Video Game Artist<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-5\">Role of a QA Tester<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-6\">Role of a Video Game Producer<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-7\">Role of a Video Game Studio Director<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-8\">Supporting Roles in the Video Game Industry<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#careers-in-game-development-9\">The Independent Developer<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-2\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Role of a Game Designer<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_designer1.png\" alt=\"image_designer\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>When most people dream about making their mark in the video game industry, they usually imagine developing their own video game concept into a working game. The role that is responsible for conceiving and designing a game is called the Game Designer. This position is perhaps the most desired by those who love to play and develop video games.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>The role of the Game Designer is to conceive, document, and present the game in a Game Design Document (GDD). Senior Game Designers are responsible for the entire game design document, while other Game Designers might focus on smaller components of a game, such as specific level or character design.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>Game design requires a deep understanding of game mechanics and how they interact with story and character (see upcoming modules focusing on Story and Character). This experience initially comes from vast experience playing games (QA Testing is included here). However, a game designer must be more than a fan of playing games. What is more crucial is the ability to look beyond the screen and understand how the game interacts: both with the player and within the game itself. The best way to establish a game design career path is to play, design, and theorize about games from an early age. It is also a good idea to have at least some technical knowledge on how video games are actually made.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>Historically, Game Designers were often programmers. As things evolved, creative talent and technical talent have sort of split the position in some cases. This said, it has been possible for Game Designers to enter the field with only writing backgrounds. Typically the writer has demonstrated a successful career as a non-video game writer\/designer. This, however, is changing. Today, Game Designers are expected to have a broad set of skills including programming, understanding of software and hardware, mastery of plot and character, and of course, a grasp on fundamental and abstract game design. In addition, Game Designers with a firm understanding of visuals, such as UI design and art, will have an advantage.<\/p><h3>Education<\/h3><p>Although there are many schools with game design programs, many are still trying to understand the ever expanding core skills that a Game Designer must focus on. In all cases, Game Designers of the future are going to do better with an emphasis on programming in their education. College students will also want to include courses on creative writing, logic, and mathematics, particularly: trigonometry, linear algebra, calculus, and analytic geometry. Helpful majors include Computer Programming, Computer Science, and Visual Communications with an emphasis on computers.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>Entry level Game Designer jobs are nearly non-existent. This is in part because it is the most popular position for people seeking to work in the video game industry. Like the movie star, it is often thought of as the \"glamour\" position in the industry. It is the perceived position where one can flex their creative muscle and envision something amazing that has never before been seen. Realistically, this position is going to someone who has a proven track record of quality storytelling or game mechanic design. More reasonable entry level Game Designer positions might include level designer, character designer, quest designer, effects designer, or scripter.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>According to the International Game Developers Association, there are four basic pay models for Game Designers:<\/p><ul><li>Basic Game Designer<\/li><li>Lead Designer<\/li><li>Level Designer<\/li><li>Writer<\/li><\/ul><p>Game Designer positions typically start around $50,000\/year and can increase as far as $80,000. Senior game designers can make as much as $120,000 with a successful track record. \"Rock Star\" Game Designers, those famous for a previous and popular work, can earn much more.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-3\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Role of a Video Game Programmer<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_programmer1.png\" alt=\"image_programmer\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>The foundation of any video game is programming. Here the complexities of writing code transforms design, art and story into an interactive experience we call video games. This is the work of the Programmer.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>A Programmer's job is to turn a Technical Design Document (TDD) into working code, and in turn, into a working game. They are responsible for the game functioning as designed and integrating all of the components such as art, UI, and game play.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>The best way to initiate a career as a Programmer is to simply start programming and learning how to write code. There are many free programs out there to get started just by searching the Internet. Many start with engines that require only scripts and slowly transition to writing actual code as they progress their skills and understanding.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>As stated, programming requires tremendous discipline, attention to detail, and focus. Starting early is the best way to develop the long-term skills that will be needed for a successful career as a Programmer. Fortunately, the Internet is full of resources to get started. Many will specialize in a particular focus or programming language, and in fact, this is a very smart path to take. Choose carefully, however, as these things change rapidly and often studios will have their own unique choices. Finally, having a good memory and the ability to think in abstract ways are incredibly helpful traits to have as a Programmer. The primary programming language of game development is C++; however, the entry positions are going to be more focused on scripting languages or languages that are appropriate for development tools such as C#. Lua is one of the most popular languages for game scripting. When you learn one language well, you can typically jump to other languages fairly easily<\/p><h3>Education<\/h3><p>Most entry level programming positions require, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree in computer science. Trade schools can also offer courses focused on programming. The truly competitive will have an advanced education with an undergraduate degree from a notable university. Math and science courses never hurt. That said, in the game industry, one can do pretty well if they can demonstrate exceptional work. For most, however, a college education is a good investment for a Programmer.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>Programming is an excellent focus for obtaining entry level positions in the video game industry. Quality Programmers are always, and will always, be in high demand. Be prepared, studios will often want candidates to demonstrate their knowledge in a test given during the interview process.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>According to Game Developer Magazine, Programmers command some of the most respectable salaries in the industry. The average entry level salary of a Programmer in the video game industry is around $50,000\/year. Experienced video game Programmers can easily command upwards of $90,000\/year.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-4\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Role of a Video Game Artist<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_artist1.png\" alt=\"image_artist\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>Video games are largely a visual medium. Though once game art was extremely limited, today's games allow near photo-realistic images. It is the duty of the video game Artist to create the look and feel of all visuals in a game including colors, textures and the overall art style of the project.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>Artists play a critical role in developing the look of a game. In industry terms, Artists can specialize in different categories of game artist, such as: concept artist, texture artist, character artist, background artist, environmental artist, and more. Artists may also branch out to 3D modeling and animation.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>For Artists desiring a career in video games, it is a smart idea to start painting digitally as early as possible. Video game Artists today also must master the Wacom tablet and Photoshop (or their equivalents) long before their first job as a working video game artist. It is also a good idea for students to delve into art theory, color theory, and design theory early in their studies.  For character Artists, studying anatomy is highly recommended.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>Often, Artists in the video game industry are hired for very specialized and focused jobs requiring specific knowledge or training. Beyond possessing expert skills in art, Artists might also be required to have some understanding of programming or software and how art integrates into a game.<\/p><h3>Education<\/h3><p>There are plenty of art schools and colleges that will give a quality education in art. Strictly speaking, however, what is really going to win a job is an outstanding portfolio. Schools can help teach theory and develop discipline, but many Artists are able to train themselves. Perhaps the most valuable quality of a formal art education is the ability to take courses in support subjects such as computer science and anatomy.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>There are many entry level positions for Artists in the video game industry, however, there is also an abundance of struggling Artists seeking those positions. There is also the industry's trend of outsourcing art to consider. Working as an Artist in games today is highly competitive and even though art and video games are inseparable, not every studio hires full-time artists on staff.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>Pay ranges vary greatly for Artists. Small studios may have tiny budgets for art and still have people knocking down their doors for the opportunity to be a working artist on a game, no matter what the pay is. Other studios only hire contract artists which, again, can vary greatly in terms of pay. An artist with five years of experience working full time in the industry is paid an average of $50,000.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-5\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Role of a QA Tester<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_QA.png\" alt=\"image_QA\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>Another popular position in the video game industry is the Quality Assurance Tester, or QA Tester. This is because many gamers dream of being paid to play games, and the QA Tester is a dream job for those individuals.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>QA Testers troubleshoot games to discover bugs and glitches in the programming or continuity issues in the gameplay and story. In many ways, they are paid to play games and find ways to break them before their faults are released to the public. That said, there is much more to QA testing than just playing games. Intense documentation is the foundation of QA testing which means it is a lot of work outside of just playing a game.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>Most QA Testers are obsessed with figuring out how to find a game's flaws and exploiting them in ways the game designers never conceived. For people who like to play games like this, QA testing is the perfect job. The best way for students to explore QA testing is to volunteer for public Beta testing when it is offered.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>QA testing requires keen attention to detail. It also requires some skill in diplomacy as feedback to developers must be concise, yet authoritative. This aspect of QA testing also requires excellent writing and documentation skills. Overall, computer, organizational, writing, and technical skills are going to be used daily.<\/p><h3>Education<\/h3><p>A college degree is not strictly needed for a career in QA testing, but as competition for jobs increases, a degree will help to separate one from the masses. There are trade school courses in QA testing that will certainly give some advantage, but they are rare. A degree in computer sciences will certainly help but does not replace experience in Beta testing.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>There a lots of entry level QA positions in the industry, however, paid positions are harder to get. As mentioned, developers have turned to video game fans to help in QA testing, often requiring fewer in-house personnel. Fortunately, there are many kinds of QA testing needed, and not just in the game development industry.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>QA testing as entry level positions can start low on the pay scale. This is because there is so much interest and demand by fans to be part of this process. Game testers start around $20,000\/year or even less. Experienced Lead QA Testers, however, can reach upwards of $90,000\/year. The average is around $47,000\/year.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-6\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Role of a Video Game Producer<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_producer.png\" alt=\"image_producer\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>Producer can be a difficult position to define as the roles can vary from studio to studio. In general, Producers are overseers. They are responsible for bringing together schedules, budgets, and all personnel into a coherent development process that leads to the successful completion of a game.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>There are many similarities between a Video Game Producer and a Hollywood Producer. Once the similar named title was a poor fit for what a Producer does in video games, but as time has passed, the Producer role in games has been better defined and is now accepted as a core position. To be sure, the Producer plays a crucial role in game development today.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>There is little one can do outside of actual experience to develop skills as a Producer. Producers must be masters of having a big picture view of a project and that comes from practical knowledge. Any type of project management, however, develops skills a Producer will need. In addition, it is not unusual for Producers to be promoted or shifted from other game development positions such as those mentioned in this Module.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>Producers are usually judged by results. Did the project finish on budget? Did the end product meet the goals of the GDD? Producers need an excellent overview of the entire game making process. They often come from other fields once their experience is enough to give them expertise in understanding how each department works and combines to make a game. Producers need attention to detail and the ability to see a project in scope of all of its parts.<\/p><h3>Education<\/h3><p>Business and management degrees are most applicable to producer positions, but mean little until one gains some actual (and successful) Producer experience. In general, Producers do well with a broad education and lots of project management practice.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>There are no entry level producer positions. Producers are typically hired from staff &#8211; those that have shown exceptional organizational and people skills are typically promoted. They may also be hired based on their past success in project management.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>Because Producers must have a body of experience before they can work as Producers, base pay is higher when compared to other positions.<\/p><ul><li>Less than three years of experience: Average $50,000<\/li><li>Three to six years of experience: Average $70,000<\/li><li>Six plus years of experience: $90,000<\/li><\/ul><p>Those who demonstrate tremendous success on their projects can command even more.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-7\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Role of Video Game Studio Director<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_director.png\" alt=\"image_director\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>Director is another position whose duties can vary from studio to studio. In many companies, the role of the producer or executive producer fulfills the same role as a Director.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>For the most part, Directors represent either the top level of management oversight (aka executive producer) or are in charge of creative oversight (aka Art Director\/Creative Director). Because of the entertainment focus of most video games, Directors are often skilled in one or more of the following disciplines as part of their areas of expertise: business, marketing, technology, art, and story.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>Directors are made, not born. It takes years of industry experience to earn the right to be considered a professional Director in the video game industry (with the exception of independent developers, of course). Directors are drawn from producers, game designers, programmers, artists, and other positions once their level of expertise surpasses their value in these fields as strictly focused disciplines.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>The biggest requirement for being a Director in video games is a long and impressive resume. In particular, successful completion of complex, high-tech, high-budget projects.<\/p><h3>Education<\/h3><p>Business and management degrees may seem like a logical educational focus for long term goals of being a Director, however, this is not always the case. Many Directors come from a writing or art background with a lot of project management experience mixed in.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>Once again, there are no entry level Director jobs. One must earn the right through years of experience and success. That said, gaining experience as a community manager is a great place to get your feet wet for future Director positions.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>Directors' pay can start as high as $90,000, depending on their relevant experience. For experienced Directors with a history of successful and profitable video game development, there really is no limit to the value a Director brings to a video game company.<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-8\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Support Roles in the Video Game Industry<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_sound2.png\" alt=\"image_sound\" width=\"611\" height=\"404\" \/><p>So far we have looked at what may be considered the “glamour” roles in the video game industry: those positions with the greatest popularity and understanding from the fans of video games. There are, however, many other positions required to make a successful video game. Best of all, many of these positions offer less competition for entry level jobs.<\/p><h3>Marketing Manager<\/h3><p>Games don't typically sell well if nobody knows they exist. Just like blockbuster movies, games need marketing to reach the public's attention. All too often, marketing is an afterthought in the video game industry, however, even a low budget game can find clever ways to market itself, particularly through the Internet and a good Marketing Manager. Average Salary: $55,000\/year<\/p><h3>Localization\/Translation<\/h3><p>Video games are popular all over the world and are often translated to multiple languages by a Translator. Game tutorials, character dialog, and all screen information are just some examples of elements that may need translation so the game will sell in foreign markets. Average Salary: $51,000\/year<\/p><h3>Technical Support Specialist<\/h3><p>Once a game is released to the public, the Technical Support Specialist is there to help customers with any technical issues they may have. They are the public relations face of the company when it comes to technical support for the product. Average Salary: $40,000\/year<\/p><h3>Writer<\/h3><p>Not all games require a dedicated Writer beyond the game designer. When they do, it's often a story or character driven game requiring a lot of dialog and plot. Technical writing is also an option for Writers wanting to find jobs in the video game industry. Technical Writers translate the mechanics laid out in the GDD into language for programmers to turn into code. Average Salary: $45,000\/year<\/p><h3>Market Research Analyst<\/h3><p>Many companies employ a Market Research Analyst to study trends and market forces to help determine sales strategies and demographics to target. They also determine prices and the best way to sell the product to an audience. Market research analysis, as a tool, is often overlooked before game development, and many video games fail in the market because they neglect to study trends and audiences.  Average Salary: $52,000\/year<\/p><h3>Composer<\/h3><p>Separate from the sound engineer, the Composer writes and records the music in a game. Composers have a musical educational\/experience background including knowledge of music composition and theory. Average Salary: varies<\/p><\/div><a id=\"careers-in-game-development-9\" class=\"dest\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Independent Developer<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_indie.png\" alt=\"image_indie\" width=\"627\" height=\"433\" \/><p>The video game industry is incredibly diverse. While it is true that it typically takes vast amounts of money, time, and people-power to create a large, complex video game, there are plenty of developers making games on shoe-string budgets and almost no personnel. These are the Independent Developers.<\/p><h3>Role<\/h3><p>The Independent Developer (or Indie Developer) must be all things at once, finding shrewd ways to fill the roles of game designer, artist, sound engineer, and all the rest. Many Independent Developers are single individuals or very small teams. Typically, this means the games they make are smaller in scale and often very niche in the audience they seek.<\/p><h3>Background<\/h3><p>Independent Developers come from diverse backgrounds. Many are programmers which eliminates the need to hire the most expensive personnel. Often Independent Developers are small teams with just enough expertise and diversity to cover all the needed fields.<\/p><h3>Requirements<\/h3><p>Independent game development requires a lot of time. Without huge budgets and hordes of workers, making even a small game is time consuming. It also requires a high level of expertise and dedicaton from each member of the small development team.<\/p><h3>Distribution<\/h3><p>Independent Developers face many challenges. Distribution is one concern. Once it was nearly impossible to compete for shelf space with big game developers. Now, however, the market is wide open to Indie Developers with Internet browser games, Apps, and consoles that allow indie games to be sold through their platforms. Without these avenues of distribution the indie game market would not exist as it does today.<\/p><h3>Entry Level Expectations<\/h3><p>Just like with studio games, indie games often fail to make a profit. Without marketing budgets, Independent Developers have to be very clever in spreading word of their creation. Today's App markets and console platforms present tremendous opportunities to make, market, and sell independent video games.<\/p><h3>Salary Expectations<\/h3><p>Most Independent Developers make games because they love to make games. If they are lucky, their first game will make enough money for the Independent Developer to make another modest game. Of course, some indie games do catch the public eye in a big way and make millions. That lightning in a bottle, however, is quite rare.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~careers-in-game-development-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":null,"instructions":"<h1>Goal<\/h1><p>In this Exercise, we will choose one of the video game career positions discussed in this Module and formulate a written plan that will prepare us for our first entry-level position at a game studio.<\/p><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Review the material in this Module and choose one position in video game development.<\/li><li>Write an essay that demonstrates how best to prepare for that position's career path.

The material in this section is for educational and reference purposes only and is not presented by an attorney or legal scholar. It is always prudent to consult a licensed attorney before making any legal decisions.<\/p><h1>Overview<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprt_copyright.png\" alt=\"iprt_copyright\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>People create bodies of work for a variety of reasons: to make money, to share an idea, or to just entertain. Regardless of the reasons, someone has to put time and effort to create an original work. It makes sense that any creator would want to protect their creations (their intellectual property) from being stolen or misused. This is why we have intellectual property laws, which protect copyright, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets.<\/p><p>Often these protections are displayed to the public represented by a symbol. For example:.<\/p><p>© is the symbol for something being copyrighted<\/p><p>™ is the symbol for an unregister trademarked<\/p><p>® is the symbol for a registered trademark<\/p><p>But what do they mean? And what legal ramifications do we need to be aware of in developing video games?<\/p><p>There are four main categories of intellectual property: Copyright, Trademarks, Patents, and Trade Secrets. Each covers a different aspect of protecting a body of work.<\/p><p>Copyright includes things such as the notes or words in a song, the story in a book, characters in a video game, art, and\/or any original designs.<\/p><p>Trademark encompasses company names and logos, titles of movies and games, and marketing slogans and catchphrases.<\/p><p>Patents cover inventions and technical innovations such as in software, hardware, and technical designs.<\/p><p>Trade Secrets are things like a company's mailing lists, contracts, formulas, and development tools.<\/p><p>This module will cover the following topics relating to Intellectual Properties and Video Games:<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-2\">What is copyright?<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-3\">Obtaining Copyright<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-4\">Copyright and Universal Ideas<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-5\">Copyright and Derivative Works<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-6\">Copyright and Fair Use<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-7\">Trademarks<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-8\">Trade Secrets<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-9\">Trade Secrets in the Video Game Industry<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-10\">Protecting Trade Secrets<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-11\">Patents<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-12\">Software Patents and Video Games<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-13\">What is Intellectual Property?<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-14\">Intellectual Properties in Video Games: Design<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-15\">Intellectual Properties in Video Games: Coding<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-16\">What is Open Source Code?<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-17\">Open Source vs. Free Software<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ip-and-video-games-18\">Creative Commons – US<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>What is Copyright?<\/h1><p>Copyright is literately what it says: the right to copy or make a duplicate. To have this right, the person must be the owner of the material or have permission from the owner to make the copy. Traditional, people pay money for that permission. For example, say someone writes an original novel and obtains a copyright on that novel. This means only they have permission to create new copies of their novel. For anyone else, it is illegal to copy the work without permission. Through this restriction, they are able to set terms for others to be allowed a copy of your work. Typically, this restriction is lifted on a “pay per copy” basis, which is how writers and artists are able to make a living off their work. .<\/p><p>Once someone has legally purchased a copy of a work, that copy is theirs to read, watch or listen to as they see fit. Typically, however, you DO NOT have a right to make more copies of the copy you purchased. The creator or owner of the property still holds copyright. <\/p><p>From here copyright laws can become quite complex but the most important thing to know is that copyright laws are used to protect your right to control the reproduction of bodies of work you have created. Also note that this work does not have to be a written document. Copyright can apply to music, images, and even computer code.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Obtaining Copyright<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtmage2.png\" alt=\"iprtmage2\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Copyright laws can differ from one country to another; however, in the United States there are eight different categories for what can qualify for copyright:<\/p><p>> Literary works<\/p><p>> Musical works, including accompanying words, if any<\/p><p>> Dramatic works, including accompanying music, if any<\/p><p>> Pantomimes and choreographic works<\/p><p>> Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works<\/p><p>> Motion pictures and other audiovisual works<\/p><p>> Sound recordings<\/p><p>> Architectural works<\/p><p>Video games typically fall under “other audiovisual works”, but may also fall under “literary works”. A copyright granted to a video game will cover the visuals, sounds, characters, plots, and source code as it accumulates into an overall original body of work. A qualified IP lawyer can help decide what category (or categories) a property should fall under. Remember, there may be costs associated with copyrighting or establishing an Intellectual Property including possible legal fees and registration fees.<\/p><p>For copyright, registration is optional but recommended in case litigation becomes necessary. Some legal copyright protections are granted automatically when an original work is published or “fixed into a tangible medium”. A video game released on Steam would qualify for this. Still, taking the time to register is the best way to protect copyright.<\/p><p>Copyright is typically granted for a fixed period of time. For video games (made after 1978) copyright is granted for 95 years after initial release to the public.  During that time frame, the owner of the copyright can demand others obey their right to grant copyright as they see fit. After that time frame, the original creators are considered to be no longer able to claim exclusivity and the Intellectual Property becomes open to the public (also called Public Domain). Obviously, no video game has yet become public domain. <\/p><p>Breaking copyright (that is, making an unauthorized copy) will typically lead to a nasty “cease and desist” letter from an attorney. It can also lead to being sued for damages. Finally, in some cases, breaking someone's copyright can lead to criminal charges. It really depends on the desire of copyright holder.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Copyright and Universal Ideas<\/h1><p>One important consideration is that copyright is only given to the specific way a piece of work accumulates into something new; that is to say, what is truly original about it. Facts, universal concepts, and the like cannot be copyrighted. For example, anyone can write a curriculum on game design. All of the concepts will be universal, such as common theories in game design. These ideas are not copyrightable; however, the exact wording, layout, and design in describing these concepts to an audience can be.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_concept.png\" alt=\"image_concept\" width=\"530\" height=\"472\" \/><p>For another example, say you wrote a sci-fi novel. Even though Star Wars has spaceships, it doesn't mean your story can't have them as well. Spaceships are a universal concept when it comes to stories set in space.  Now, if you call them X-Wings and have pictures of Star Wars X-Wings, you are going to be in trouble, because those exact spaceships are part of an IP that the Disney Corporation owns. <\/p><p>Sometimes the creator of something will not know something is copyrighted, or even exist, and still violate copyright. This is rare, but can happen.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-5\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Copyright and Derivative Works<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtImage3.png\" alt=\"iprtImage3\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>We often see video games adapted from movies or even the other way around. These are called derivative works. They are new but derived from an existing Intellectual Property. The same general laws apply. A derivative work is defined by statute as:<\/p><p>“based upon one or more pre-existing works such as translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgement, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.” <\/p><p>What this means is that a video game studio that wants to make a Star Wars Game based on The Empire Strikes Back, must first obtain permission through a legal license with Disney (owner of the Star Wars IP).  <\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-6\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Copyright and Fair Use<\/h1><p>In the U.S., copyright can sometimes be circumvented, in a limited way, under certain conditions. These exceptions are usually under what is called Fair Use. The concept of Fair Use is that for purposes of education, parody, or other social need, limited portions of copyrighted material can be reproduced without paying a licensing fee and without fear of legal consequences.<\/p><p>For example, school textbooks can reproduce limited portions of other people's copyrighted works and reprint them for students to learn. They must still give credit to the copyrighted material, but they don't have to ask for permission. Another example of Fair Use is parody. Satire and parody are thought to have social benefits and creators of parody are allowed some freedom to identify the IP's they wish to mock. <\/p><p>Fair Use has many stipulations which protect the original IP. Strictly commercial usages are not allowed. This can become complicated, for say, a for-profit educational company.  Is that educational or commercial? How much sampling of a copyrighted work is okay to reproduce? It is important to note that assuming material is being used as Fair Use, does not necessarily make it so. Companies can still send that “cease and desist” letter and they can still take someone to court if they do not agree that the usage of their copyright does indeed qualify as Fair Use.  Again, this is the realm of law statues and lawyers and one should always seek valid legal advice before assuming Fair Use of any Intellectual Property.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-7\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Trademarks<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtImage4.png\" alt=\"iprtImage4\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Trademarks deal with words, images, logos, and visual designs meant to distinguish intellectual properties from each other. This is meant to protect the integrity and marketability of one's creation and future creations under that banner. <\/p><p>Look around and you will see trademarks everywhere:<\/p><p>-\u0009Car company emblems on every single car on the road<\/p><p>-\u0009The design of a can of soda<\/p><p>-\u0009The sports logo or any sports team's mascot design<\/p><p>-\u0009Corporate branding and packaging design on every single item in your local grocery store.<\/p><p>-\u0009The name and logo of your favorite musical group. <\/p><p>-\u0009Just about everything else that has image design used as branding for a company, product or service.<\/p><p>All of our favorite (and not so favorite) video game characters are probably trademarked. Pac-Man, Mario, Master Chief all have protected usage from trademarks. Often we will see this symbol “™” which tells us the property is considered trademarked while it goes through the process of public scrutiny. Or this mark “®” which indicates the trademark is approved and in use. Usage is a major component to holding a trademark. In general, a company must publicly use the trademark at all times the trademark is claimed. That means, it has to exist on a currently marketed or used product, service or medium. <\/p><p>Another thing to consider is that a particular trademark only covers a particular category of goods or services. If we trademark the name and logo of a game, say Tempered Steel, we would not have trademark rights in food packaging. So there could be Tempered Steel the video game and Tempered Steel vitamins. <\/p><p>Much like copyright, you are not allowed to reproduce the trademarked image without the expressed approval of the trademark owner. It sounds simple, but it can become very complex. For instance, suppose you are filming a movie that involves a massive car chase on the streets of Los Angeles. Every single automobile has a brand logo and\/or a corporate logo. Are you in violation of trademark if the camera picks up the Chevy “bowtie” on a car that is just in the scene? The answer is, “Maybe”.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-8\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Trade Secrets<\/h1><p>The United States Uniform Trade Secrets Act defines a trade secret as:<\/p><p>“Trade Secret” means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program device, method, technique, or process that: (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.”<\/p><p>Now that we are clear on that…wait, what? This may need a little more explanation.<\/p><p>Trade secrets include any information a company has, or anything a company does that gives itself an advantage; however, is not commonly known or practiced by others in their industry or the public. This can encompass a wide variety of “secrets” including:<\/p><p>\u0009• A recipe or formula, such as the secret ingredient of a soft drink<\/p><p>\u0009• A process, such as a factory that makes specialize parts<\/p><p>\u0009• A design, such as a machine or invention<\/p><p>The purpose of a trade secret, as opposed to a patent, is that when a patent is filed for, the secrets of the formula, process, or design become known to the public. For example, if the Coca-Cola Company applied for a patent on its secret formula, they would expose that formula to the world. Even if their patent was accepted (which is not clear it would) they would only have exclusive rights to the exact formula they patented. Meanwhile, every other cola company now knows the secret of Coca-Cola and starts to experiment with it. It is possible another company could alter the recipe just slightly and make something even better than Coke. None of this is to Coca-Cola's advantage. Instead, they keep the formula under heavy security, with only a few select people in the company having access. <\/p><p>To qualify as a trade secret it must fulfill these three requirements:<\/p><p>1.\u0009It must actually be a secret and not general knowledge in an industry or with the public.<\/p><p>2.\u0009It must be economically viable because it is a secret. In other words, if others in the industry could use it, they all certainly would because it gives a clear advantage to the business. <\/p><p>3.\u0009The owners of the trade secret must treat it as valuable and seek reasonable protections from industry theft. <\/p><p>The protections trade secrets receive are fairly nebulous. Even as a trade secret, it is perfectly legal for soft drink competitors to try and figure out the formula of Coca-Cola through chemists, trial and error, and reverse engineering. At the same time, real cases of industrial espionage (such as theft) are already illegal due to other existing criminal laws.  <\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-9\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Trade Secrets in the Video Game Industry<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtmage11.png\" alt=\"iprtmage114\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Trade secrets do exist in the video game industry. Here is a list of some of the most common instances:<\/p><p>     • Customer lists. This is a common trade secret across many industries. Companies will often collect data on their clients or customers for internal analysis. This information is kept secret from competitors who would greatly value such information. The Valve Corporation, for example has data on their registered users other companies would covet.  <\/p><p>     • Development tools. Video game companies often create in-house development tools that would hold value to competitors if they had them.  In-house game engines and other internally built systems fall under this category.<\/p><p>     • Code. Systems within games can do amazing things, but sometimes it can be difficult to tell exactly how something was achieved in the coding.  Internal elements of a released game that have not been disclosed to the public could qualify as a trade secret. In some cases, the game designers may even be hiding trade secrets from players. Everquest, for example, attempted to hide the actual numbers and coding that determined combat to prevent players from figuring out ways to trump the game. <\/p><p>     •  Details of licensing agreements. Game engines are often licensed at an un-fixed price. Companies will negotiate based on value and purpose. If a video game company had access to what others are paying for the engine, they could position themselves much better when haggling for a price.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-10\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Protecting Trade Secrets<\/h1><p>For the most part, it is up to the company or studio to protect its trade secrets. Corporate espionage is illegal, but if someone steals a secret, there is little hope of stopping them from exploiting it beyond a lengthy legal process. By the time that is over, the whole world could know their trade secrets. <\/p><p>Video Game Studios often try to keep a lot of information under the public radar. Even knowing a certain game is under development can become a trade secret of sorts if there is potential monetary value in uncovering that secret. For example, competitors may be desperate to know when Half-Life 3 will be released (or if it is even being developed). For competitors developing similar games, it would be hugely valuable to know what the game looks like, what its unique mechanics are, and when it was being released.  With such information they could shift their game slightly to better compete by introducing similar mechanics or esthetics. Most importantly, they could calculate when to release their game based on when Half-Life 3 was being released. They could push to release their game first or much later to avoid direct competition. <\/p><p>Obviously, studios do not want this done to them, but it can be difficult to control. One of the ways studios protect themselves are with Non-Disclosure Agreements or NDAs.  These are legal contracts that bind the signees to silence regarding company trade secrets, often with heavy financial penalties for breaking them. <\/p><p>Another way studios protect their trade secrets is through good ol' fashion security. This can be anything from shredding documents before throwing them away to secured rooms under heavy lock and key. It may sound a bit paranoid considering these are games we are talking about, but remember, this is a multi-billion dollar industry. If rummaging through a game studio's trash can result in valuable information, then a rummaging they will go. <\/p><p>Despite laws, precautions, and ethics sometimes trade secrets get out. This, again, is where real legal council is crucial. At minimum, “cease and desist” letters will be sent. More likely, if espionage or someone breaking a NDA is the cause, litigation in the courts may be required. If it comes to a court case, more than likely, the company will seek monetary compensation for damages done.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-11\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Patents<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtimage33.png\" alt=\"iprtimage33\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Patents are designed to protect inventors and their rights to own and control their inventions. In exchange for compete disclosure to the public of the details of an invention, a patent grants exclusive rights to that invention to the inventor for a limited amount of time. <\/p><p>Patents are granted and enforced by governments (sovereign states) and can vary in the degree of exclusivity depending on the country the patent originates in.  In addition, patents are far more difficult to acquire than a copyright or a trademark. In order to qualify for a patent the applicant for a patent must prove certain claims made by the invention itself. In short, the inventor must demonstrate that invention does what it says it does. <\/p><p>There are other considerations, as well. Patents are not granted to inventions that are already well known to the public before the filing for the patent. Basically, there is a grace period in which the person or entity applying for a patent must disclose to the public their intention to be granted a patent, thus allowing other patent holders to officially protest the request for the new patent.  <\/p><p>Another consideration in gaining a patent is the inventions “obviousness”. That is to say, in order to be granted a patent, the invention must be, well, inventive, or have what is called an “inventive step”. This is sort of a litmus test to see if an invention is too simplistic or lacks a definitive step forward from what already exists in terms of its technology or state-of-the-art advances.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-12\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Software Patents and Video Games<\/h1><p>In many cases, original programing of computer software is considered an invention and is applicable to patent rights. The exact qualifications that makes software patentable, again, varies greatly from country to country. As of today, the legal definition of a software patent does not exist. Instead, it is categorized under “abstract ideas”, which does create some confusion for those seeking software patents. <\/p><p>In fact, there is great debate on whether software should be granted patents at all. The basic argument being that software patents fail at being clearly inventive and non-obvious and that software patents harm innovation.  <\/p><p>This is an important consideration in the video game industry. Most video games require a large investment in people, time, and effort. If software patents are unintentionally violated because they don't turn out to be as “non-obvious” as first thought, then huge amounts of investment money can be wasted. Not to mention the wasted efforts of the people involved.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-13\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>What is Intellectual Property?<\/h1><p>Intellectual Property (IP) is a term that describes inventions, artistic designs, images, writings, or any combination of these elements created purely by the mind of the creator for commercial purposes. <\/p><p>Intellectual property laws cover all laws that protect people's work or creations, such as copyright, trademark, trade secrets, and patents. They give an owner of a piece of work the legal right to deny, charge for, or give away their intellectual property. <\/p><p>In simple terms, intellectual property rights give exclusive control of a property to the owner of that property. For example, The Disney Corporation now owns the intellectual property rights to both Marvel Comics and the entire Star Wars franchise. No one else can create, copy, market or profit off these properties without the permission of Disney. <\/p><p>Generally that means you cannot reproduce any material (either visual, audio, written, or coded) or profit off these properties. For example, you may be a terrific artist who can draw comic book characters like a professional; however, you are not allowed to paint and sell Marvel character images without permission because you do not own the copyright. <\/p><p>Observant readers have probably seen massive intellectual property infringement on the Internet: Illegal download sites, misuse of corporately owned pop culture icons, even entire Youtube videos of completely stolen characters and visuals.  One might be tempted in believing that the controllers of these imitated IP's are okay with this sort of copyright infringement. The truth is, they can send that “cease and desist” letter at any time as well as sue for damages. Just because everyone is doing it, doesn't mean lawyers won't eventually become involved.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-14\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Intellectual Properties in Video Games: Design<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_UserInterface.png\" alt=\"image_UserInterface\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>So what exactly does all this mean to us in the video game industry? Well, the truth is, intellectual property issues affect nearly every aspect of game development. In particular for games (almost all of them these days) with design, story, sounds, visuals, and code. <\/p><p>A game's design is copyrightable, including its story, characters, original setting, mechanics, and in some cases, gameplay. A good game design document will help establish all of the original material that the copyright will seek to protect. <\/p><p>Of course, as always, there are stipulations and complications. Obviously, there is a lot of common themes and gameplay in video games. Can someone copyright the ability to jump from one platform to the next? Can someone claim modern Earth as a copyrighted setting for a game?<\/p><p>As with copyright in other mediums, no one can own a fundamental idea or fact. And so, an intellectual property is formed from the unique combination of original and universal elements put into the game. <\/p><p>We will stress again, that these become legal definitions that can be confusing and make sense only to lawyers. Always seek professional legal advice before assuming anything about your own or others intellectual property. That said, the most important thing to avoid when developing a game (from an intellectual property POV) is to avoid plagiarism at all costs. Plagiarism is knowingly or unknowingly stealing, in part or whole, someone else's work.  Even if a work is public domain, it is still considered unethical to copy from someone else and then hide that fact. In almost all cases, and in particular in the age of search engines, plagiarism will be uncovered eventually. Once that happens, not only is one open to legal consequences, they must also face the loss of personal integrity and community support.  <\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-15\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Intellectual Properties in Video Games: Coding<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/image_code.png\" alt=\"image_code\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Modern Intellectual Property laws have expanded to include computer coding under copyright law. For proper U.S. registration, some portion of the code must be submitted for review and viewable by the public. Obviously, this does not have to be code that gives away any trade secrets and is still under copyright of the company that posted it. As a game developer, be cautious and deliberate when selecting what portion of code to submit.  <\/p><p>Remember, others have come before you. Within the US patent system you may have demonstrate your code is “novel” or “not-obvious”.  In other words, that it solves a problem in a way that has not previously been solved with similar code. <\/p><p>In the end, once an IP for a game is submitted (including any copyrights, trademarks, or patents) there will be a waiting game. Once fees and applications are submitted (it is best to have a lawyer specializing in IP law for this process) there is still a waiting period after the game has been released. During this time, other individuals and companies can see what is presented and make any claims of copyright, patent, or trademark infringement.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-16\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>What is Open Source Code?<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtimage15.png\" alt=\"iprtimage15\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Not everyone is profit-minded when it comes to intellectual property rights. In fact, many encourage the free use of their intellectual properties by making their creations open source. This means anyone is allowed to alter, edit or otherwise use the created material as they see fit. Generally, the consumers of open source material have similar goals with that material (typically to improve or expand the material).<\/p><p>For video games, Open Source usually means open code. That is to say, the source code created by the game's designers is given to the public to use and modify in new and interesting ways. Often this is a coordinated and collaborating effort of an entire community. <\/p><p>As an example of open source code, GG|interactive's (creators of this curriculum) parent company, GarageGames, offers its Torque 3D and Torque 2D game engines as Open Source. Users must agree to the MIT license which reads:<\/p><p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. This allows a lot of freedom for anyone who wants to develop games on those engines. The company also hosts a forum for Torque users to gather and discuss their projects and share tips, creating a community of open source developers.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-17\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Open Source vs. Free Software<\/h1><p>Open source software does not necessarily mean free in terms of cost. In fact, the term “free” more often refers to “freedoms to modify” rather than actual costs. Free software, on the other hand, typically is free in both price and unrestricted to modify.  Free software has no limitations or restrictions on anyone changing or editing the software code for their own uses.  <\/p><p>In simple terms, all free software is open source.  However, not all open source software is absolutely free (either in monetary costs or freedom to modify). It all depends on the imposed restrictions by the owners of the source code.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ip-and-video-games-18\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Creative Commons – US<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/iprtimage16.png\" alt=\"iprtimage16\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Creative Commons – United States is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to the education and support of people, organizations and communities that use their open source material and, more generally, those who are interested in intellectual property laws and growing open source content for free public use. <\/p><p>One of the features of a Creative Commons license is that it offers tools that, “give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work.” (www.creativecommons.org\/licenses\/) <\/p><p>What is does is allow copyrighted material to be copied, distributed, and otherwise used for non-commercial purposes while the original party still retains copyright in all other cases.

As the last Module demonstrated, there are many laws that either restrict or enable the use of intellectual property and provide clear guidelines for legal use. Choosing to ignore those restrictions through plagiarism, making illegal copies, or profiting off of someone else's protected creative work are clear examples of unethical practices. Laws, however, can be confusing, and sometimes people are unaware that they have committed a crime. In those cases, is ignorance an excuse for unethical conduct? <\/p><p>This Module will look at some ethical pitfalls in the video game industry in order to understand appropriate levels of legal compliance and social responsibility.<\/p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><ul class=\"anchorGroup\" style=\"text-align: left; display: inline-block;\"><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-2\">Plagiarism<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-3\">Legal and Ethical Use of Information in the US<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-4\">Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 1<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-5\">Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 2<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-6\">Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 3<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-7\">Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 4<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-8\">Unauthorized Use in the Digital Age<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-9\">The Non-Disclosure Agreement<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-10\">The Non-Compete Clause<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-11\">Other Contractual Issues<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-12\">Privacy Issues<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-13\">The Ethics of Collecting Consumer Data<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-14\">Evaluating Digital Footprints<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-15\">Identity Theft<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-16\">Internet Privacy Acts Intro<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-17\">Internet Privacy Acts Examples<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-18\">Ethics in the Video Game Industry<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-19\">Social Value and Video Games<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-20\">Social Responsibility in the Video Game Industry<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-21\">Understanding the Entertainment Software Ratings Board<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-22\">ESRB Process<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-23\">ESRB Criteria<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-24\">ESRB Category<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-25\">International Ratings Boards<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-26\">Pan European Game Information<\/a><\/li><li><a class=\"ankor\" href=\"#ethics-in-video-games-27\">The Controversy of Content<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-2\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Plagiarism<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsplagiarism2.png\" alt=\"ethicsplagiarism2\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Plagiarism was mentioned in the IP and copyright discussions as a legal concern but deserves extra mention to students as an ethical issue as well. First and foremost, plagiarism is a form of theft. Depending on the circumstances, plagiarism could lead to legal consequence such as fines. More than that, however, plagiarism is unethical. There is no defense for claiming another's original words or ideas as your own. For some, particularly students, the temptation to plagiarize can be very compelling, but even a few highly respected journalists and politicians have caved to the shortcut of plagiarism. Chances are, in the age of Internet, plagiarism will be discovered. When this happens, the damage to one's personal and ethical reputation could be devastating. The consequences of plagiarism, however, should not play a part in deciding whether or not to plagiarize. One's ethics should dictate the discipline to never even contemplate such actions.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-3\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Legal and Ethical Use of Information in the US<\/h1><p>Let's be honest, even if we fully want to avoid stepping on someone else's copyright or intellectual property, we don't always know what is legally restricted. It can also be confusing to know when something can be used if the authors or source works are cited and credited.  What if we are making a game just for fun and don't intend to make any money off it? Do we still need permission to use others' intellectual property? How do reporters, school textbooks and social commentators in the US deal with these issues?<\/p><p>The concept of Fair Use is an attempt to answer some of these questions. United States law acknowledges cases of fair use and uses a four-point “test” to determine fair use of an intellectual property owned by another party. It states:<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsfairusefull.png\" alt=\"ethicsfairusefull\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>As we see, this is still a very broad, and perhaps vague, explanation. We will try and translate the four main points.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-4\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 1<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsfairuseone.png\" alt=\"ethicsfairuseone\" width=\"530\" height=\"472\" \/><p>This is an allowance to use others intellectual properties for the purpose of non-profit education. The reason for this is to allow for the betterment of the public good through knowledge and the sharing of information that benefits society as a whole.  To declare this point as a legitimate reason to break copyright law, we must demonstrate that using it does indeed advance human knowledge in some new and obvious way.  US courts have determined that this definition is fairly broad, allowing social commentary and parodies (think comedians poking fun at stuff) are acceptable cases of fair use, even when making a profit.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-5\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 2<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsfairusetwo.png\" alt=\"ethicsfairusetwo\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>In general, a creative work does not have to be considered “good” in any objective way to be an intellectual property. That said, no matter the quality of a creative work, real-world facts within that body of work are not protected by copyright. Facts and “truths” are considered to be under the perpetual ownership of the society as a whole. For example, mathematics are not copyrightable because they express an uncontested reality that everyone has a right to access. However, a math textbook can be copyrighted in terms of how it lays out the information through unique design<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-6\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 3<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsfairusethree.png\" alt=\"ethicsfairusethree\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>To be fair to the original work, there are limits to how much of a privately owned IP one can simply lift (cut and paste) and use in an unrelated commercial or public context. Here, the rule of thumb is “less is better.” It is unacceptable, even in an educational, non-profit context, to sample large portions of text or material and use it as content filler. There is still a lot of legal “wiggle room” in this statement. How much is too much? In general, the idea is to sample the minimum amount of material needed, but there are no clear and absolute guidelines as to what that amount is. Taking entire pages of content is probably way too much. Reposting a few sentences is usually more acceptable. It is really a game of hit and miss while trying to be honest in the intention of fair use and not just being lazy. <\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-7\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Fair Use Doctrine; Clause 4<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsfairusefour.png\" alt=\"ethicsfairusefour\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Finally the law considers the effect using protected material through fair use has on the original IP itself. Specifically, courts look at whether or not a particular claim of fair use harms the value of the IP.  The first criterion is if the fair usage creates a directly comparative product in the marketplace that replaces the sited work. That means that duplication is unacceptable. The second point courts look at is to consider harm in other industries might create indirectly. For example, copy and print stores that copy entire chapters of texts books for students trying to save money.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-8\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Unauthorized Use in the Digital Age<\/h1><p>Unauthorized use of an intellectual property is pretty much every other example one can think of outside of a paying for use or that which falls under fair use. That means downloading unauthorized music, movies, and books are theft as much as stealing CDs and paper books from stores. It doesn't matter that the copied version didn't cost the creators any money; it is still legal and unethical to take without permission.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicscontrac3t.png\" alt=\"ethicscontrac3t\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Here some may want to argue the economics of the modern music and film industry, and claim that downloading piracy is actually good for overall sales. This is just a form of rationalizing poor ethics. Even if there are strange economic forces at work, the act of downloading without permission is still unethical and illegal.<\/p><p>Video game development is a multi-billion dollar industry and, as such, companies tend to get litigious when their intellectual property rights are violated. This makes the use of legal contracts very prevalent in game studios and corporations. As potential future employees in the industry it will extremely helpful to understand some the implications of certain agreements we may be asked to sign: In particular, the legal and ethical positions these contracts bind us to.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-9\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Non-Disclosure Agreement<\/h1><p>A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) typically means that the signee agrees not to discuss or publish any private information of the company or studio. Private company information typically includes absolutely everything except what the company authorizes in press releases. This is a legal contract and once signed, it would be unethical to then disclose private information of the company. NDA's are often signed during interview stages in staffing. It is important to give an applicant enough information on the project in order to properly interview and assess their skills for the job. Yet, if that person is not hired, companies don't want them talking to the competition about project secrets.<\/p><p>By signing the NDA, the signee agrees to the terms of keeping silent. This is typically for some set amount of time (two years being average). Remember, by signing such an agreement, we legally bind ourselves to the letter of the agreement. If any part of the agreement is not acceptable then we must ask for an amendment before proceeding. To sign an agreement and then complain or break the agreement is both unethical and unprofessional.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-10\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Non-Compete Clause<\/h1><p>A non-compete clause in a contract is a bit more serious than a non-disclosure agreement. These contracts typically require the signee to agree to not work for any competitor for the length of the agreement. For example, a company might hire someone, but then require them to sign a NCC declaring that they promise not to work for any competitor for the next two years. In some states, this contract is binding even if the person who signed the contract is fired from their job before the two years are up. That means, by signing the contract, one might be unable to even look for work in their area of expertise because of a rigid non-complete clause. The ethics of such contracts are questionable. Obviously the company requiring a non-complete arrangement gains all of the protection at the expense of the signee. Still, non—complete clauses are very common in the video game and other industries. If a person refuses to sign one, they are the ones that may find themselves completely removed from the industry.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-11\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Other Contractual Issues<\/h1><p>Many people seek work developing video games because the work is so fun and rewarding from a consumer point of view. Within the industry itself, the practice of ethics and fair play can vary greatly from company to company. Typically, those hired on at a studio will be offered contracts. The binding legality of the contracts can vary from state to state, so it is a good idea to know the state laws pertaining to certain stipulations within the contract.<\/p><p>For example, some contracts insert clauses that claim all creative endeavors of any employee during the course of employment. Depending on how it is worded, this could mean that writing, art, coding, and designing done on projects unrelated to work are also immediately owned by the company, even if the material was never created at work or during work hours. Some contracts may claim immediate ownership of any unregistered intellectual property material that exists on their computers, even if it is just a private email containing information. Be aware of such requirements in contracts. Most companies that require such things find that they cannot attract top talent with these kinds of agreements. By refusing to work for these companies, they are focused to reconsider fairer contracts that do not bind creative freedom and send talent looking for other jobs.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-12\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Privacy Issues<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsprivacy3.png\" alt=\"ethicsprivacy3\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>In the near future that is right now, data collection and privacy rights are in conflict. The ethics of hidden “cookies” or unavoidable data collection software is now becoming a much bigger issue in the courts than ever before. Are companies being ethical in their collection and use of personal information? Do they promise not to share any collected data or is that the purpose? What rights do consumers have? What are the dangers of having personal information freely available in the Web?<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-13\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Ethics of Collecting Consumer Data<\/h1><p>Internet privacy has become an issue of serious concern. Most consumers aren't aware of how much personal information they are leaving behind as they go about their normal Internet viewing habits. As software developers, there are many ways to collect data from users of our products or websites. How we collect this data and inform our users of this collection is an important ethical consideration. Many consumer advocates see a danger in this kind of data collection. In particular the ethics of data collection on people who are unaware of the extent of the practices and how they unknowingly contribute due to unannounced data collecting programs on Websites.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-14\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Evaluating Digital Footprints<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsfootprints3.png\" alt=\"ethicsfootprints3\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Using any type of digital service on the Internet leaves what are now commonly called “digital footprints”. These footprints are all the traces of data and personal information left by users either intentionally or unintentionally. Most often this occurs through Web browsing. Programs seeded on Websites collect data such as what was looked at, what was purchased, and any personal data that is reveled in the course of exploring the site.<\/p><p>When this is done without the person adding any information about them self to the site, it is called a passive footprint. That is, the person is doing nothing intentional to give out data and information. When a person willingly and deliberately gives data and personal information to a site (say to make a purchase using a credit card) it is called an active footprint. The person volunteered the data.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-15\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Identity Theft<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsidentitytheft3.png\" alt=\"ethicsidentitytheft3\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>Identity theft is the ultimate crime surrounding digital footprints. While identity theft does not require a digit record of a person's daily life, it certainly helps. Credit card information, bank passwords, personal information are all surprisingly easy to access for smart “cyber criminals”. Many times people are tricked to giving up information with email scams.<\/p><p>All of this type of behavior has ethical implications that modern society is still coming to terms with. There is no moral grey area in outright identity theft, but the extent in which internet companies and individuals accept data collection and how they use and\/or secure that information is now a hotly discussed topic.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-16\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Internet Privacy Acts Intro<\/h1><p>With advances in communication technology (from telephone to video conferencing) comes unprecedented access to information on people using electronic devices, such as computers, cell phones and tablets. Indeed, even simple apps for games could allow access to one's personal information stored on their smart device. Many app purchasers don't know to look at the requirements an app demands from its user. This could include access to one's email, location, photos, browser history, and more. In all cases, potential users of an app should ask themselves if the evasive requirements to access an app are worth the downsides of having one's personal data collected. While the dangers of data collection are nothing new, they have certainly accelerated through digital pathways on the Internet. As a counter-measure to hacking, unethical data collection, and to improve Internet safety, many Acts have been proposed or passed in Congress. The question becomes, do these Acts actually protect citizens' rights to privacy or are they designed more to insure government access to personal data in the age of terrorism and mass surveillance.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-17\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Internet Privacy Acts Examples<\/h1><p>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was enacted in 1986 as an expansion to existing restrictions on government phone wiretapping of American citizens. This legislation was in response to new Internet technologies and included computer and electronic communications as well as the telephone. For many, this legislation is grossly out of date with modern technology and, in fact, contains provisions that grant government powers counter to protecting privacy.  In particular, the Act is out of touch with modern methods of consumer data collection and storage, allowing government many loopholes for its own desire to gather data on citizens. <\/p><p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is another Act enacted by Congress in 1986 that has expanded its scope since then. The Act sets forth criminal offenses in the areas of computer hacking, stealing of information, and acts of fraud perpetrated through the Internet. Once again, the details of the Act are a cause for some controversy in terms of civil liberties and its definitions of illegal acts on the Internet.<\/p><p>In 2011, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act was introduced by Congress as an attempt to strengthen the US government's ability to access electronic data to evaluate and counter cyber terrorism. To this day, the act is still being adjusted (sometimes renamed) and reintroduced in Congress. So far, concerns over civil liberties have prevented it from becoming law.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-18\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Ethics in the Video Game Industry<\/h1><p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has created a Code of Ethics (http:\/\/www.igda.org\/?page=codeofethics) that states principles of professional conduct specific to the video game industry. Many of the principles stated are promises to abide by (and understand) intellectual property rights. The rest of the document expresses a personal ethics foundation for now and future leaders of the industry and guidelines to treating people fairly and respectfully. The organization's website also discusses related social issues such as censorship, violence in games, court decisions related to the game industry, and news articles that relate to these topics.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicscodeofethics3.png\" alt=\"ethicscodeofethics3\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicscodeofethics2.png\" alt=\"ethicscodeofethics2\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicscodeofethics3.png\" alt=\"ethicscodeofethics3\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>As an entertainment industry with legions of fans, both young and old, there are many issues of social value and social responsibility we should be aware of. More often than not, these issues center on kid's access to content that is sexually or violently graphic and the general ethics of depicting gratuitous acts in games.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-19\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Social Value and Video Games<\/h1><p>The idea of social value is that something offers more than purely inconsequential enjoyment, but also (or instead) offers some greater value to society as a whole. This “something” enriches people's lives in some way, makes society “better”, and increases “well-being”. These can be very subjective values to some, but in general, the concept is that the work in some way makes the world a better place to live.<\/p><p>For video games, this is not always a common goal. In fact, many games are perfectly content to entertain while offering no social value at all. There are some games that have been marked as being deliberately unethical because they allow players to freely explore criminal behavior and even what many consider immoral acts. Are these games unethical in their lack of social conscious? Philosophers, politicians, and religious leaders and artists have debated morality for thousands of years and the conclusions are still being discussed. For game makers, there is little in terms of US law that will censor or restrict content. Many markets require an Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) review and rating before they will accept the game and often they will reject games that receive Adult rating.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-20\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Social Responsibility in the Video Game Industry<\/h1><p>Social responsibility is sort of the flip side of social value. It is the questioning of not only how to determine some social value, but whether or not video games should be required to be socially responsible to public safety and moral standards. This idea stems from some people perceiving harm in games that do not take it upon themselves to self-censor immoral or inappropriate material.<\/p><p>Psychiatrists, politicians, community leaders, and concerned citizens have been voicing their opinions on this issue for decades, going back to even before Elvis Pressley's scandalous contortions in the 50s. It is not an issue that is likely to be agreed upon any time soon. Many feel that some moral standards absolutely must be established because of the increased exposure to minors these games have (and rely upon for sales). Others feel that the seeds of social deviancy are rooted in other causes and that applying moral standards to entertainment properties is an infringement of free speech.<\/p><p>Video games are put under the same scrutiny that music, movies, comics, books, and other entertainment products are. The fear that deviant behavior can arise from children's unblocked access to violent or sexual material is something the video game industry must acknowledge even if they disagree that such material is the root of real problems. A crass approach to public relations on these concerns will only fuel the fire that the industry is amoral and unconcerned with social responsibility.<\/p><p>It is very important, then, for game developers to at least consider the public reaction to potentially offensive or child sensitive material. In particular, marketing strategies that target age groups younger than is appropriate for a game is an industry trend that causes additional controversy in the area of ethics.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-21\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Understanding the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) Ratings System<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicsesrb.png\" alt=\"ethicsesrb\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>In 1994 the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) was formed to categorize and rate the content of video games and other digital media in the US. Much like the Motion Picture Association of America and film, the goal of the IDSA was to give parents a guide to determine whether a game's content was appropriate for their children. The results are the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB).<\/p><p>In 2004, the IDSA became the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), but with the same goals of the original organization: to give parents and consumers a method of determining the appropriateness of video games for different age groups (and in particular, minors). Much like the rating system of movies, games are categorized by age groups depending on how much adult content they contained.<\/p><p>It should be noted that obtaining an ESRB rating is not required by law. This is a voluntary process that most studios choose to utilize. That said, many consumers look for an ESRB rating when buying a game, particularly if they are buying a game for a minor. Just like movie ratings, there is considerable social pressure to submit a body of work for a content rating and inform the public of any issues of language, violence, or sexual content. Studios that refuse an ESRB rating are at risk of retailers refusing to carry the game and of being accused of unethical business practices by consumer groups and the media, whether true or not. There is also a responsibility of the retailers to not sell the mature games to minors. This can be deliberately ignored for extra sales at the retail level or be nearly impossible to tell with online sales. Either way, businesses committed to refuse cash on the basis of social responsibility are a mixed bag.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-22\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>ESRB Ratings Process<\/h1><p>The ESRB's main concern for rating video games is to limit a minor's access to inappropriate content. Games are reviewed and then given a “sticker” that lists any questionable content and then suggests age limitations for consumers buying the game. Once a studio accepts a rating, they agree to the ESRB's Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices. This includes such things as clearly displaying the content rating on packaging and agreeing to certain ethical marketing principles such as not targeting ten year olds in marketing for adult games. Once the rating process is initiated by a studio they agree to adhere to their standards. At that point, the ESRB will monitor a studio's compliance to the guidelines and can even levy fines for failure to follow ESRB requirements.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-23\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>ESRB Ratings Criteria<\/h1><p>The ESRB focuses on two broad criteria when issuing a rating: age appropriateness as determined by broad content descriptors. The broad content descriptors look for any and all of the following when determining age appropriateness:<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Drug and Alcohol References<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Blood (animated blood, realistic blood, Blood and Gore)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Violence (Cartoon, Fantasy, Intense, Sexual)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Comic Mischief<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Crude Humor<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Language<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Nudity<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Gambling (real or simulated)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Suggestive Themes<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-24\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Rating Categories<\/h1><p>Based on the levels of content of the above criteria, a game will be given one of the following age category ratings:<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Early Childhood<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Everyone<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Everyone 10+<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Teen 13+<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Mature 17+<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Adult 18+<\/p><p>There are two other common classification categories for video games:<\/p><p>As mentioned, intellectual property laws are complex, but in general, if you are not the creator\/owner of a piece of writing, an image, a song, a video game – whatever it may be – then you do not have the right to reproduce, copy, market or enjoy that property without permission.<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Refused Classification (RC)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Rating Pending (RP)<\/p><p>The first is Refused Classification or RC. This is usually done because the game's developers know they will get an undesirable rating. For instance, Adults Only (AO). Many corporate chain stores will not sell games that receive an Adults Only rating. On the other hand, these stores will also not sell games that have refused classification. If a studio knows they will be selling their game in a market that does not care about ESRB classifications, they may choose to skip the process all together.<\/p><p>The second “unrated” classification is when a game has been submitted to the ESRB and awaits its decision, or when a studio is still working on a game and has not yet submitted the game for classification. This is called Rating Pending or RP. Sometimes a game receives a rating and then the studio decides to make changes in order to receive the rating they wanted for the game.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-25\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>International Ratings Boards<\/h1><p>The ESRB standards only apply to games sold in the US (and those countries that defer to the ESRB). Many other countries have their own version of a video game ratings board. In some cases, these boards are made up of government officials, while others are independent boards with little to no government involvement.  They all serve the same basic function: to classify content of video games. Some countries will ban games that refuse to be rated (RC) or that receive Adults Only or even Mature ratings. In many countries, banned games are illegal to sell and can bring heavy penalties or even jail time if distributed.<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-26\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>Pan European Game Information (PEGI)<\/h1><p>PEGI is the European version of the ESRB. It is widely recognized in Europe as the model for ranking game appropriateness for children of different ages and points of development. PEGI uses a system similar to the ESRB, focusing on age recommendations and labels that designate appropriate age limits for games. Also, like the American ratings system, PEGI gives broad descriptors of why a game should is recommended for age restricted. It should be noted that European PEGI, in general, has looser community standards towards sexual content and nudity, but has stricter considerations for violence that the American ESRB.<\/p><p>The PEGI age guidelines are:<\/p><p>      •\u0009  PEGI 3 (suitable for all ages)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  PEGI 7 (contains material that may be frightening to small children)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  PEGI 12 (contains some mild cartoon violence or nudity)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  PEGI 16 (contains realistic violence, profanity, drug-use, or nudity)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  PEGI 18 (contains graphic violence, sex, or drug-use)<\/p><p>PEGI has slightly different categories of descriptors than the ESRB:<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Bad Language)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Discrimination (not part of ESRB considerations)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Drugs)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Fear (not part of ESRB considerations)<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Gambling<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Sex<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Violence<\/p><p>      •\u0009  Online Gameplay<\/p><\/div><a class=\"dest\" id=\"ethics-in-video-games-27\"><\/a>&nbsp;<div class=\"accent\"><h1>The Controversy of Content<\/h1><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\".\/images\/ethicscontroversy.png\" alt=\"ethicscontroversy\" width=\"664\" height=\"390\" \/><p>The idea that authoritative agencies are needed to protect the moral decency of our citizens is not new to video games. Even comic books have been accused of indecency, which led to the Comics Code Authority in 1954. Concerns over the lyrical content of rock, rap, and punk music have also been used to justify the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) which established the record rating “sticker” system used today. And of course, there is the Motion Picture Ratings System that assigns films ratings of G, PG, PG=13, R, or NC-17. So what is the controversy?<\/p><p>There are many people, particularly those in the business of creating art and entertainment, which feel content ratings boards are tools of censorship. No artist enjoys submitting their work to a committee only to be told it is indecent in some regard. At the same time, the pressure to avoid potential negative ratings can cause studios to put political correctness above their creativity and artistry. This is often regarded as necessary to protect minors from accessing what is called “harmful content”. The problem is that the definition of harmful content can be arbitrary and based on the opinions of small sections of the overall consumer community. This can put artists at risk for breaking these community standards even if they are a thousand miles away.<\/p><p>So where does a desire to protect children from depictions of sex and violence cross the line into unwarranted content control by outside agencies? It is a question video game developers are still trying to figure out.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~ethics-in-video-games-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Material"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":null,"instructions":"<h1>Goal<\/h1><p>Demonstrate understanding how video games can either promote or suppress the concept of social value and ethics.<\/p><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Choose any of the Game Stack games available from previous exercises.<\/li><li>On a piece of paper (or a digtial document) write the following:<\/li><ol><li>Describe three elements of the game that could be altered to make the game more socially concious, in terms of having positive social value.

Here we will put into practice what we have learned from the previous Arcs and Modules. As a quick review, we have covered the abstract concepts of game theory; the value of documentation; the foundations of game structure; implementing mechanics and level design; touched on visuals, story, and character; and finally we are considering careers, ethics, and intellectual property laws within the video game industry as we prepare for our final game design project. Along the way, we have emphasized the key lessons in these discussions with game building exercises using Game Stack.<\/p><p>In this, the final exercise for the Game Design course, we will focus on a game design capstone project: the creation of our own, original version of a Game Stack game. There will not be any additional video lessons in this Module. Once we have watched the overview video, the next step is to go straight to the exercise and follow the steps to reach the goals of the project.<\/p><p>There is no one correct way to approach the final game design project. The only real error one can make is by skipping over any of the requirements of the project. Beyond that, this is an opportunity to be creative and unique in your approach to game design.<\/p><p>Finally, whether we realize it or not, by completing this course, in addition to expanding our knowledge and understanding of game design, we have also taken the first crucial steps into the world of game programming. Game Stack uses blocks as a form of “visual programming”, when deciding how to implement the variables, logic, and functions of the scratch programming language. As we have made adjustments to these Game Stack game templates, our minds have been thinking like coders. Completing this Game Design course demonstrates a level of understanding of abstract concepts, game design, game theory, and even math. Game Programming is an extension of the concepts and goals of this course. By setting our goals on understanding code, and developing the ability to write code, we add tremendous value to our place in the modern workforce, and greatly increase our chances of a long and happy career in video game development. So don't stop now. Keep exploring, learning, and making games for the world to enjoy.<\/p><\/div><!--page:~~game-project-reference-text~~-->","title":"Reference Matertial"},{"bIsChecked":true,"exercise":null,"instructions":"<h1>Goal<\/h1><p>In this final game design project, we will utilize our game design skills, as well as familiarity with Game Stack basic programming, to create an original version of a Game Stack game.<\/p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-701\" src=\".\/images\/gamestackfullshot.png\" alt=\"gamestackfullshot\" width=\"743\" height=\"576\" \/><h1>Steps<\/h1><ol><li>Choose a Game Stack game we have previously done an exercise for.
